<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>The story of the life of Elizabeth of
Bavaria, Empress of Austria and Queen
of Hungary, is one of the saddest in the
history of royalty, and in some respects
recalls the story of the life of Marie Antoinette.
Both their lives were sorrowful, both ended tragically,
the one at the hands of an assassin, the other
upon the guillotine. Elizabeth will not be remembered
in history as a sovereign, for everything
connected with the throne and with court life was
distasteful to her, but rather as the beautiful, sorrowful
daughter of the Wittelsbachs. She was not only
one of the most beautiful women of her time, but an
accomplished scholar and linguist, a good musician,
and well versed in history, science, and art. She
was a passionate lover of the woods and mountains,
and was happiest when she was walking or riding
among them, or associating with the Hungarian
people. She was no more at home with the Viennese
than was Marie Antoinette with the Parisians. Her
domestic life was saddened by estrangement from
her husband, by lack of sympathy among her relatives,
by the terrible tragedy which ended the life
of her son, Prince Rudolph, and by other tragedies
which involved the happiness and sometimes the
lives of those nearest to her. At last her sufferings
were ended by the dagger of a cruel anarchist assassin.
As the author of this volume says: &ldquo;She died as
she had often wished to die, swiftly and painlessly
and under the open sky. Who can say that her
last breath was not a sigh of thankfulness and
peace?&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Diamond Wedding</span></h2>
<p>On the ninth of September, 1888, an unusual
event occurred in the princely house
of Wittelsbach. Maximilian Joseph, the
head of the ducal line of Vorpfalz-Zweibr&uuml;cken-Birkenfeld,
and his wife Ludovica (Louise),
daughter of King Maximilian First of Bavaria and
his second wife, Caroline of Baden, celebrated on
that day their diamond wedding, both bride and
groom having been barely twenty years old at the
time of their marriage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Few princely couples have been closely connected
with so many of the reigning families of Europe.
Their eldest son, Ludwig Wilhelm, renounced the
succession to wed an actress, Henrietta Mendel,
who had received the title of Countess Wallersee.
Helene, the eldest daughter, married the Hereditary
Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and their daughter
Louise, by her alliance with Frederick of Hohenzollern,
formed new ties between the Wittelsbachs
and the royal house of Prussia. The next daughter
was Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary, whose son in
his turn took for his bride the King of Belgium&rsquo;s
daughter, Stephanie. After Elizabeth, in the family,
came Karl Theodore, well known as an oculist, and,
on his father&rsquo;s death, the head of the ducal line of
Wittelsbach. He first married his cousin Sophie,
daughter of King John of Saxony; the second and
present wife is Marie Josepha, Princess of Portugal.
Two other daughters, Marie and Mathilde, allied
themselves with the younger branch of the Bourbons.
Marie became the wife of King Francis
Second of Naples and Mathilde married his half-brother,
Count Louis of Trani. The youngest
daughter, Sophie, was betrothed at one time to her
cousin, King Ludwig Second of Bavaria, but afterwards
married Duke Ferdinand d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, nephew
of Louis Philippe of France, while the youngest son,
Max Emanuel, married Am&eacute;lie of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotha, thereby becoming connected by marriage
with Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The Wittelsbachs have always been eccentric.
Mental disorders have been common with them,
and during the last century between twenty and
thirty members of the family have died insane.
Yet in spite of their peculiarities and eccentricities
they have always been exceedingly popular with
their subjects, as much for their personal charm as
for their devotion to the happiness and welfare of
their people. The annals of Bavaria have little to
record of treason or conspiracy against the princes
of the land, but tell much of the loyalty and sacrifices
of life and property on the part of the people.</p>
<p>Duke Maximilian Joseph was born at Bamberg,
December 4, 1808. He was the son of the weak-minded
Duke Pius Augustus of Bavaria and his
wife, Am&eacute;lie Louise, Princess of Arenberg. &ldquo;The
good Duke Max,&rdquo; as he was called by the people,
was the only direct descendant of his grandfather,
while his wife, on the other hand, was the youngest
of a large family of sisters. Two had been princesses
of Saxony and one a Queen of Prussia, while
the fourth was the mother of the Emperor Francis
Joseph of Austria-Hungary. King Ludwig First
of Bavaria was a half-brother, and there were also
two half-sisters. One was married first to the King
of W&uuml;rtemberg and afterwards to the Emperor Francis
First of Austria-Hungary; the other became the
wife of Napoleon&rsquo;s stepson, Eugene Beauharnais,
and the grandmother of Kings Charles Fifteenth
and Oscar Second of Norway and Sweden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Thus most of the dynasties of Europe were
interested in the festivities in honor of the aged pair,
and sent congratulations to the secluded spot on
Starnberg Lake, where the event was celebrated, and
where many touching proofs of the loyalty of the
people of Bavaria were also received.</p>
<p>Maximilian Joseph belonged to the most eccentric
and popular branch of the Bavarian royal family.
Educated directly under the eye of his grandfather,
his childhood had been spent partly in Bamberg,
partly in Munich. At the age of eighteen he entered
the University of Munich, where he applied
himself assiduously to the study of history, natural
science, and political economy, and on coming of
age he was given, as provided by the Bavarian constitution,
a seat in the Senate chamber. But he did
not aspire to fame, either as orator or statesman;
nor did he strive for military distinction, though at
the age of thirty he was assigned to the command
of a regiment of cavalry and in 1857 was invested
with the rank of general. His natural love for
science, literature, and art more often led him to
exchange his uniform for the simple civilian dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>During the youth of the Duke a musician, named
Johann Petzmacher, created a great stir. He was
born in 1803, the son of an innkeeper in Vienna,
and in his eighteenth year accidentally learned to
play the homely zither with which the mountaineers
of the Austrian and Bavarian highlands accompany
their folk songs. He soon became so absorbed in
the possibilities of this instrument that he gave up
everything else to devote himself to it. His fame as
a performer soon spread far and wide. He played
before the most select circles of Vienna and even at
court, and made tours throughout Germany, being
received everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm.
Duke Max first heard him in 1837 at a concert in
Bamberg, and determined to learn to play the zither
under the master&rsquo;s direction. Petzmacher was introduced
to the would-be virtuoso, and from that
time until his death made his home with his art-loving
patron. The Duke in 1838 undertook a
long journey through Asia and Africa, and his musician
friend accompanied him. Savages listened with
delight to his playing, and as the two friends sat
on the top of the Egyptian pyramids or camped in
the hot desert sands, the homely melodies carried
their thoughts back to loved ones in Germany, and
dangers and hardships were forgotten. While on
this journey Duke Max wrote several musical compositions
which were afterwards performed in public
and received with great applause. Under the name
of &ldquo;Phantasus,&rdquo; he wrote a collection of dramatic
poems and novels that showed no small literary
talent. More noteworthy than these, however, is
his &ldquo;Travels in the Orient,&rdquo; a book of considerable
merit. On his return to Bavaria he had a circus
ring constructed in the rear of his palace in the
Ludwigstrasse, at Munich, which aroused much curiosity,
where he frequently made his appearance as
ringmaster with members of the Bavarian nobility
as circus riders and performers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>It was only during the winter months that he remained
in Munich. All through the Summer and
Autumn he lived with his family at his castle Possenhoffen,
beautifully situated on Lake Starnberg.
This picturesque region, shut in by a chain of lofty
Alps, seems as if created to inspire poetical sentiment,
and various members of the art-loving Bavarian
royal family have built summer palaces there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Max Joseph was an enthusiastic hunter and spent
whole days roaming through the forests and mountains
about Possenhoffen. Enjoyment of the beauties
of nature was one of his passions, and he often
came out in the Winter for a few days at a time.
On these excursions he wore a simple hunting costume,&mdash;short
gray jacket, open shirt with suspenders,
feathered cap, knickerbockers with long
stockings, and heavy-soled shoes. He generally
went about on foot, but sometimes made use of the
mail-coach, the usual mode of conveyance at that
time. His fellow travellers seldom suspected that
the good-natured huntsman who chatted so freely
with them was a duke and the brother-in-law of
their sovereign. He was continually besieged with
petitions, and rarely did any one appeal in vain to
the comparatively poor but warm-hearted prince.
His benevolence was one of the chief causes for his
popularity in Munich, though he was most beloved
by the people as the gay zither player who with
his instrument under his arm would enter their cottages
quite like one of themselves, and play for the
young people who were never weary of dancing to
his music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>His wife was very different. She had not his
artistic, impulsive temperament, and the good-humored
simplicity with which he mingled with the
common people did not altogether meet with her
approval. The proper maintenance of her position
seemed no more than a duty due to her high birth
and rank, and for this reason she was never as popular
as her husband, though her many admirable
qualities commanded the greatest respect and admiration
during the sixty years that she remained
mistress of Possenhoffen. She was naturally endowed
with a good mind and had been carefully
educated. Honesty and love of truth were among
her most marked characteristics, and all her life she
held firmly to what after mature reflection she believed
to be right. Like the Duke, she preferred
the seclusion of the country to city life, and all
through their happy married life she acted as a balance
to her loving but restless husband as well as
friend and adviser of her children, who adored and
looked up to her always. Her glance was keen but
kindly. Smiles came easily to her lips, and there
was an air of distinction about her that sprang from
true nobility of heart. She was one of those strong
souls born to help others, but in little need of support
themselves. She was by no means unambitious
for her children, though the trials suffered because
of them taught her by degrees to place less value
upon outward splendor. She disliked to excite personal
attention and cared only to live as quietly and
modestly as possible.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Birth and Childhood of Elizabeth of Bavaria</span></h2>
<p>It was the Christmas Eve of 1837. The bells
of Munich were proclaiming the festival when
Max Joseph, wandering about in one of the
poorer quarters of the city, met a woman dragging
herself painfully toward him with a bundle of
firewood on her back. She addressed him with the
usual Bavarian greeting,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praised be Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ever and ever, Amen!&rdquo; replied the Duke,
adding kindly, &ldquo;Why are you carrying such a load
upon your back this holy Christmas Eve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you why, gracious Duke,&rdquo; said the
woman; &ldquo;it is because my children have no Christmas
gifts, and I have been in the forest gathering
wood so that they may at least enjoy a warm
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did right,&rdquo; returned the Duke. &ldquo;As for
me, I have already received my Christmas gift, for
my wife presented me to-day with a charming little
daughter who is to be called Liese, and I am so
happy over it I wish you too to have a Merry
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>He wrote her name and address in his notebook,
and after the darkness had fallen two servants
appeared at the poor woman&rsquo;s dwelling with two
heavy baskets filled with food. At the bottom of
each was a banknote for a considerable sum.</p>
<p>The child born on this day was Elizabeth, afterward
Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary.
In many countries it is regarded as a sign of misfortune
to be born on Christmas Eve, but the
happy childhood of the little princess had no foreshadowing
of the experiences of her after life.
Most of her early years were spent at Possenhoffen,
which her father had bought some time
before her birth. The great park and surrounding
forests were the child&rsquo;s first playgrounds, and developed
in her sensitive soul a deep love of nature
and of freedom.</p>
<p>The Duchess&rsquo;s chief concern was the education of
her eldest daughter, of whom she had great hopes.
Helene was nearly four years older than her sister
and was the favorite of the mother, whom she resembled
both in character and appearance. Overshadowed
by her seemingly superior talents, with
no interest in books and ignorant of the requirements
of court life, Elizabeth&mdash;or &ldquo;Sissi,&rdquo; as she
was called&mdash;grew up almost unnoticed. She loved
her sister with the enthusiasm of youth and with
the natural tendency of the ignorant to look up to
those more clever than themselves, but her father
and brothers were dearer to her than either sister or
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The little girl was the darling of the Duke. She
had inherited his love of nature, roamed about constantly
with him through the mountains, visiting
the peasants&rsquo; huts, and learned to look at life and
people through his eyes. Her bringing up in no
way fitted her for the high station she was afterward
to occupy. At the end of her fifth year she
was given a governess, but &ldquo;Sissi,&rdquo; though an unusually
gentle and lovable child, soon learned how
to wind her teacher round her finger and concerned
herself little about study, for which she had no
love. The Empress used to declare that in her
youth she was the most ignorant princess in Europe,
and the little she did know had been learned
as she sat on her father&rsquo;s knee. But if not over-taxed
with lessons, her education in other branches
was by no means neglected. The Duke was determined
that his children should be well developed
physically, and one of the best dancing masters of
the time was summoned to Possenhoffen to teach
Elizabeth and her sisters to dance and carry themselves
properly. Even in her later years the Empress
was an excellent walker and famous for her
easy, graceful carriage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Walking never tires me,&rdquo; she said once to one
of her attendants, &ldquo;and I have my father to thank
for it. He was an indefatigable hunter and wanted
my sisters and myself to be able to leap and spring
like the chamois.&rdquo; She also learned to swim and
ride and dearly loved to sit a horse and feel the
wind blowing through her hair. She was never
happier than when riding about Lake Starnberg on
her little pony, and in the winter, when forced to
stay in the capital, it was her greatest joy to escape
to the stables, where she would mount the most
unmanageable horses that could be found. One
day while playing circus, as she often did, she was
thrown by a wild, full-blooded animal. Her governess
uttered a shriek of terror, but Elizabeth
quickly rose to her feet, neither frightened nor
hurt, and laughingly besought permission to mount
the horse again, which the terrified governess refused
to grant. The happiest time in the whole
year to her was when the warm spring days made
it possible for them to return to Possenhoffen
and she could enjoy unlimited freedom once more.
She was passionately fond of flowers, and it is still
told among the Bavarian Alps how &ldquo;Liese of
Possenhoffen&rdquo; used to scramble about the wild
unbeaten mountain paths to return at last with her
arms full of edelweiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Her father taught her to play the zither, and she
often went with him on long tramps among the
Alps, stopping now and then for rest and refreshment
at some hut where they would play dance
music on their own instruments or on some they
found there. On one occasion they had done this
in a remote region where the huntsman and his
daughter were not known, and the people gave the
pretty child a piece of money in payment. Elizabeth
always kept it. &ldquo;It is the only money I ever
earned,&rdquo; she once said, when showing it to an acquaintance.
There was never much pocket money
for her to buy presents with, and she used often
to spend the evenings knitting stockings for her
mountain friends or sewing on some piece of
needlework. The country folk about Possenhoffen
idolized the little Liese, and when overtaken
by one of the autumn storms she would often take
refuge in their huts, quite alone, and sit down by
the fire to chat and laugh with old or young. Her
parents saw nothing amiss in this. Duke Max
liked nothing better than to enter into the lives of
his people, and when the mother was told how her
daughter ran about with her brothers or played the
zither in hovels while the peasants danced she but
smiled indulgently, saying: &ldquo;She is only a child. I
will take her education in hand later on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>This free life at Possenhoffen taught the little
Elizabeth to regard the woods and mountains as
her second home, and the most splendid halls of
the palace seemed small and stifling to her in comparison.
It no doubt exerted a marked influence
on her later development, and possibly furnished a
clue to her character as Empress of Austria. Had
her childhood been different, she would unquestionably
have been better fitted for the position she
was soon to occupy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Betrothal of Princess Elizabeth</span></h2>
<p>One of the first journeys Elizabeth made
with her parents and sisters was to Ischl.
It was there that Franz Joseph&rsquo;s parents
were in the habit of spending the summer
months, and the two sisters, the Archduchess
Sophie and the Duchess Ludovica, had agreed to
meet here in the Summer of 1853. The five years
that had passed since the Emperor&rsquo;s accession to
the throne had been years of struggle and anxiety.
Only a few months before, he had been wounded by
the dagger of an assassin. The internal disorders
of the Empire, however, had not prevented his
name from being linked with that of various European
princesses,&mdash;reports which were finally silenced
by his clever and strong-willed mother, who swayed
him completely and had determined that a princess
of her own house should share her son&rsquo;s double
throne. This was natural enough. Both the Wittelsbachs
and Hapsburgs are among the oldest
reigning families of Europe, both have remained
loyal to the Roman Catholic Church, and for six
hundred years alliances between them have been
common.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The Archduchess had heard much of the talent
and amiability of her sister&rsquo;s daughter Helene.
She and the Duchess Ludovica were on the best
of terms and had already secretly decided on the
marriage. It only remained for the young people
to meet and take a fancy to each other,&mdash;a matter
of some concern to the Emperor, who, though
an obedient son, was also a passionate admirer of
the fair sex. It was certainly mutual attraction that
drew Franz Joseph and Elizabeth together, though
there are many tales told of how their betrothal
came about. The following account, however, is
probably nearest the truth.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth of August, 1853, the Emperor
went to visit his parents at Ischl and meet Max
Joseph&rsquo;s family. As the travelling carriage rolled
along the dusty highway, his adjutant suddenly
uttered a cry of admiration:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, your Majesty, look yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franz Joseph drew out his field glass and caught
a glimpse of a beautiful child playing with a flock of
goats on a meadow near by. The next instant the
road turned and the town appeared in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>An hour later he was sitting with his mother
when a young girl burst into the room, unannounced,
with a bunch of wild roses in her hand.
She wore a short white frock, and a mass of silky
chestnut hair fell in soft waves about her slender
figure. It was the same youthful beauty he had
seen from the carriage. It was the first time they
had met, but she recognized him at once from the
portraits she had seen, and without a trace of embarrassment
approached and greeted him, saying
heartily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; inquired the Emperor, almost
fearing lest the lovely apparition might vanish before
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Elizabeth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile in the wonderful blue eyes won his
heart upon the spot.</p>
<p>A few hours later he was presented to the Princess
Helene, who, if not beautiful, was a bright,
intelligent-looking girl with an air of great distinction.
Had not Franz Joseph seen Elizabeth
first, Helene would undoubtedly have become his
Empress. The same day he was to dine with his
aunt and uncle. As he entered their hotel in
Ischl, he heard two voices from behind a half-closed
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg of you not to go out, Princess!&rdquo; said one;
&ldquo;you know it has been forbidden.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is the very reason why I want to,&rdquo; retorted
the other in soft girlish tones which he
recognized; and the next moment Elizabeth stood
before him, all smiles and blushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must you not go out?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am only a child and am not expected
to appear till my older sister is married. It is all
your fault, and I shall have to eat by myself, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Princess, what are you thinking of?&rdquo; cried the
governess, who now made her appearance, crimson
with anger. &ldquo;Pardon, your Majesty!&rdquo; she added,
turning to the Emperor, &ldquo;but I have had strict
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without heeding her, he offered his arm to the
young girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go out together, cousin,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I dare not!&rdquo; she replied in alarm.
&ldquo;Papa would be furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; cried the governess, and taking
advantage of her pupil&rsquo;s momentary hesitation, she
drew her into the room and closed the door with a
low courtesy to the Emperor.</p>
<p>At the close of the meal Franz Joseph turned to
the Duke. &ldquo;I have a favor to ask of my kind
host,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it not the custom in Bavaria
for the children to come in after dinner? I would
like to become better acquainted with your second
daughter, whom I saw for a moment at my mother&rsquo;s
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>All exchanged glances, and there was a moment&rsquo;s
silence, as Duchess Ludovica felt all her hopes for
Helene slipping away. The Duke replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you wish, your Majesty,&rdquo; and in
a few moments Elizabeth made her appearance,
blushing and frightened.</p>
<p>Franz Joseph had not a high opinion of women
as a rule. Young as he was, he had already had
some experience of them, but this lovely, innocent
child wrought a sudden change in him, and through
the political clouds that darkened the first years of
his reign love flashed like lightning into his heart.
That evening the Archduchess Sophie gave a ball
at which both nieces were present. The court, suspecting
that fateful events were brewing, watched
the Bavarian princesses curiously. The Archduchess
showed marked favor to Helene; the son devoted
himself to both. When during the cotillion he
handed Elizabeth a magnificent bouquet of roses,
the interest increased. Would the mother yield to
the son, or the son give way to the mother?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Franz Joseph&rsquo;s choice was already made, however,
and at the close of the ball he announced that
he would have no one but Elizabeth for his wife.
The Archduchess&rsquo; surprise and chagrin at the failure
of her cherished plan knew no bounds, but she determined
not to oppose her son&rsquo;s choice. She had
wanted him to marry her other niece, hoping to
rule her as she did him; if the crown were to go
to an immature child of sixteen instead of her
clever sister of twenty, no doubt it would be so
much the easier.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning the royal carriage
stopped before Max Joseph&rsquo;s door. The
Emperor hastened up the steps, asked for an interview
with the Duke and the Duchess, and then and
there made a formal request for the hand of Princess
Elizabeth. This was an affront to Helene
that neither her father nor her mother found it easy to
endure, but the suitor was persistent. If he could
not have the one he loved, then he would not
marry at all, and at length they were forced to
yield. Franz Joseph wanted Elizabeth to be notified
at once, but they would not consent to force
her in any way. She was still as much a child in
heart and feeling as in appearance, and when first
told of the Emperor&rsquo;s wishes she clasped her hands
in dismay, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible! I am much too young!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Love had entered her dreams, however, even if
her heart was not yet awakened. Franz Joseph&rsquo;s
impetuous wooing appealed to her impulsive nature.
She was attracted by his person and his temperament,
and without pausing to reflect, she joyfully
promised to be his wife. The betrothal took place
on the Emperor&rsquo;s twenty-third birthday, August
18, 1853.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Great were the public rejoicings when the news
reached Vienna. The glamour of romance that
enveloped the affair appealed to the popular fancy,
and a thousand tales were woven about the lovely
child who was to be the bride of their young sovereign.
Her pictures were scattered broadcast
throughout the Empire, and people were never
weary of dwelling on her beauty and the simple
home life of her early days. During the month
that the betrothed pair remained at Ischl with their
parents, crowds flocked thither daily to gaze upon
their future Empress, and returned full of praises
of her modesty and charm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Wedding Ceremonies</span></h2>
<p>On the twentieth of April, 1854, Elizabeth,
accompanied by her parents and her two
oldest sisters, started on her bridal journey
to Vienna. Peasants from all the
surrounding country thronged the streets of her
native city through which she passed, and, overcome
with the grief of parting, she stood up in her
carriage and waved a tearful farewell to the cheering
crowds.</p>
<p>The steamboat <i>Stadt Regensburg</i> conveyed the
party from Straubing to Liutz. Work was everywhere
suspended as on a holiday, and nothing was
thought of but the coming of the long-awaited princess.
At Liutz they had to go ashore to change
boats, and there Franz Joseph met them, hurrying
back to Vienna, however, so as to be there to welcome
his bride. The town was buried in flowers.
A magnificent arch had been erected. Bonfires
burned on all the surrounding heights, while torchlight
processions, theatrical performances, and serenades
concluded the festivities of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The next morning, April 22, the journey down
the Danube was resumed. The <i>Franz Joseph</i>,
which carried them from Liutz to Mussdorf, was
covered with roses from stem to stern, the cabin
hung with purple velvet, and the deck transformed
into a flower garden. It was a beautiful spring
morning. Banners waved from every roof and
tower, and the river banks were lined on either side
with cheering throngs, eager to catch a glimpse of
their future Empress. What they saw was a slender,
white-robed figure hastening from one side of
the vessel to the other and bowing continually in
response to the storms of greeting of which she
never seemed to tire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Meanwhile, at Mussdorf, the landing place for
Vienna, great preparations had been made to welcome
her. Since early morning crowds had been
flocking thither, waiting with imperturbable patience
and struggling to keep the places so hardly won.
Near the bridge a pavilion had been erected with
a wide portico whose gilded turrets and cupolas
gleamed afar, and by noon it was filled with nobles,
prelates, high officials, and deputies from the middle
classes. Stationed upon a terrace to the right were
the foreign ambassadors with their ladies; on the
left sat representatives from Vienna and other cities
under the Hapsburg rule. The weather had been
threatening in the early part of the day, but towards
noon heavy gusts of wind scattered the clouds, leaving
the bluest of skies to welcome the bridal party.
At half-past six the boat touched the shore amid
the booming of cannon, strains of music, and the
solemn pealing of bells. Franz Joseph hastened
forward to embrace his bride, closely followed by
his parents, the Archduke Franz Karl and the
Archduchess Sophie, who embraced Elizabeth and
then led her back to the bridegroom.</p>
<p>At last came the long-awaited moment when
Elizabeth, leaning on the Emperor&rsquo;s arm, entered
the Austrian capital. From thousands of throats
came the shout, &ldquo;Long live the Emperor&rsquo;s bride!&rdquo;
The sound was so overwhelming that Elizabeth
stood for some moments by her lover&rsquo;s side as if
spellbound; then, as her glance swept slowly over
the excited throng, she smiled charmingly and waved
her handkerchief to the delighted spectators. Many
years have passed since that day, many misfortunes
have overtaken Austria and the house of Hapsburg,
but eyewitnesses are still living who remember that
moment and tell of the picture the fair young princess
made as she then appeared in all her exquisite
loveliness.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH in his twenty-eighth year</i></p>
</div>
<p>The progress from Mussdorf to Sch&ouml;nbrunn was
a continuous ovation. At half-past seven they
reached the gates of the old palace, where the Emperor
once more bade his bride welcome before
leading her up the great staircase, which was decorated
from top to bottom with tropical plants and
flowers. On the following day the state entry into
Vienna took place. Every house had been decorated
by loving hands, and the streets through
which the bride was to pass were perfect rivers of
flowers. The Elizabeth Bridge, which connected
Vienna with the suburb of Wieden or &ldquo;An der
Wien,&rdquo; was opened that day and given the name of
the Empress.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
Here the mayor and council of the
city were stationed to welcome her. About the eight
statues of famous men which adorned the bridge,
thousands of rare shrubs and blossoms from the
hothouses of Princes Lichtenstein and Schwarzenberg,
the fragrance of which filled the whole
town, had been effectively arranged. As far as the
Corinthian gate stretched a triple wall of citizens,
and at short intervals young girls stood strewing
flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The thunder of cannon and pealing of bells from
every church tower in Vienna and its suburbs proclaimed
the starting of the procession. The golden
state coach was drawn by eight milk-white horses
with tall white plumes on their heads; the harnesses
were covered with gold, and the coachman, footmen,
and postilions wore white wigs. On the back seat
sat the bride with her mother. Her dress was of
red satin, embroidered in silver, and over it she
wore a white cloak trimmed with garlands of roses.
About her neck was a lace handkerchief, and in her
beautiful hair sparkled a circlet of diamonds, twined
in which was a wreath of red roses. Never had
Elizabeth more fitly deserved the name so often
given her, never had she more perfectly looked
&ldquo;The Rose of Bavaria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early on the morning of April 24, 1854, Te
Deums were celebrated in all the churches of
Vienna and the august pair attended high mass
in the court chapel. By three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon
the crowds about the Hofburg and the Church
of the Augustins, where the ceremony was performed,
were so great that barriers had to be erected
to keep a way clear for the coaches to pass. From
all parts of the Empire and of Europe guests had
been pouring into the capital. On the preceding
day alone, seventy-five thousand strangers arrived,
a most extraordinary number for those days. Even
the Orient&mdash;Alexandria, Smyrna, and Salonica&mdash;sent
representatives to the wedding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The famous old Church of the Augustins was
gorgeously decorated for the occasion. Above the
high altar rose a canopy of white velvet embroidered
with gold, under which were placed two prie-dieux,
also of white velvet. The walls and columns
of the church were hung with damask and costly
tapestry and the floor was carpeted. From a hundred
candelabra countless tapers shed a soft but
brilliant light. The Augustin Gallery, which led
from the inner apartments of the Hofburg to the
church, was similarly decorated and illuminated.</p>
<p>The marriage was to take place at seven o&rsquo;clock
in the evening. By six every available space in the
church was filled with invited guests. The gay
uniforms of the officers, the many-colored and picturesque
court dresses of the Hungarian and Polish
nobles, the sparkling jewels of the ladies, the gold-embroidered
coats of the ministers and distinguished
guests, the red robes of the cardinals, the fantastic
costumes of many of the Oriental emissaries, all
united to form a scene of incredible magnificence.</p>
<p>At the appointed time Prince Archbishop Rauscher,
the Emperor&rsquo;s former tutor, with more than
seventy bishops and archbishops in their gold-embroidered
vestments, assembled in the sacristy.
The master of ceremonies informed his Majesty that
all was ready, and the procession entered the Augustin
Gallery. First came the pages, stewards, and
gentlemen-in-waiting; next the privy councillors and
high court officials; then the Archdukes with their
chamberlains; and, last of all, the Emperor himself,
in the uniform of a field marshal and wearing all
his orders. Directly behind the bridegroom came
his mother, leading the bride on her left. On
Elizabeth&rsquo;s left was her own mother, Duchess
Ludovica, and after them followed the ladies of
the court led by the Lord Chamberlain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The bride of sixteen was radiant with all the
beauty and happiness of youth. Her wedding gown
was of heavy white silk, richly embroidered with
gold and silver, over which she wore a loose garment
of the same material with long sleeves. A
diamond clasp held the long veil of Brussels point
lace, and the bridal wreath of fresh myrtle and
orange blossoms was secured by a magnificent coronet
of diamonds which her mother-in-law had worn
at her own marriage and given to Elizabeth as a
wedding gift. A diamond necklace encircled her
throat, and upon her breast she wore the Bavarian
order of Theresa and the Austrian order of the
Starry Cross, together with a bunch of white
roses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The Emperor and his bride were met at the
door of the church by the Prince Archbishop, who
sprinkled them with holy water, after which they
knelt on the prie-dieux while the other members
of the two royal families took their places. After
a short prayer Franz Joseph and Elizabeth advanced
to the high altar, made their responses,
exchanged rings, and clasped hands. As the Archbishop
pronounced the Church&rsquo;s blessing at the close
of the ritual, a salvo of musketry sounded from
the regiment of infantry stationed on the Josephsplatz,
and the next instant the thunder of cannon
proclaimed that Austria had an Empress and
Hungary a Queen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">First Troubles</span></h2>
<p>At the time of her marriage Elizabeth was
said to be not only the youngest but also
the most beautiful Empress that had ever
sat on the throne of the Hapsburgs. Her
figure was tall and slender, her hands and feet small
and well shaped, her features regular and delicate.
She had a charming smile, wonderfully expressive
dark blue eyes, a beautiful complexion, and a mass
of waving chestnut hair that fell about her, when
loosened, like a veil, and which she wore either
hanging in eight heavy braids or wound like a
coronet around her head. With no experience of
the world and full of the confidence of youth, she
looked forward to her married life as one long
holiday. Crowned with love, all hearts should bow
before her and she would be the good genius of her
people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>But disappointment followed close upon the heels
of the first intoxication. If the lower classes were
charmed with their Empress, this was far from being
the case with an aristocracy that claims to be the
most exclusive in Europe, and there were many at
court who felt that neither by age nor rank was this
daughter of a non-royal Duke fitted to be their
sovereign. Instead of being welcomed with open
arms, therefore, she encountered only a wall of opposition
and intrigue. Far from being the brilliant
centre of homage and admiration, as she had
dreamed, she was grieved and mortified to find those
about her anxious only to deprive her of the honors
and influence that were her due. It was most unfortunate
that she should have been placed so early
in a position requiring the utmost tact and knowledge
without having had any training to fit her for
it,&mdash;a poor bird that had left the home nest before
it had learned to fly! In Bavaria she had been a
happy, care-free child, beloved by every one and so
full of the joy of life that she seemed to carry with
her wherever she went a breath of those woods and
mountains she so dearly loved. A Wittelsbach by
both lines of descent, she had inherited the characteristics
of the race, their pride and independence,
honesty and courage, to a striking degree. Even
these virtues, however, were but so many dangers,
since they made it difficult for her to adapt herself
to the rules laid down by court life. Her very
youth and freshness were out of place at Sch&ouml;nbrunn
and the Hofburg. Her ignorance and inexperience,
which were well known in Vienna, made
it seem probable that she would prove an easy tool
at court, provided she were only amused and flattered
sufficiently. But this error was soon discovered.
With the peculiarities of her race she
had also inherited their marked mental gifts, and
young as she was, her mind was quick to grasp
whatever interested her and to choose or reject with
certainty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Such a nature could not but rebel against the
restraint and monotony of court life. Its pomps
and ceremonies wearied her from the first, and little
as she resembled Marie Antoinette in other ways,
she hated etiquette even more than did that unfortunate
Queen. The court of Vienna, which had
lived by its conventional usages from time immemorial,
regarded as natural and necessary the forms
that Elizabeth considered ridiculous and childish.
She once aroused a storm of indignation by refusing
to appear at the customary state breakfast,
which consisted of various hot dishes, and ordering
some bread and sausage and a glass of Munich beer
to be brought to her in her own apartments. On
another occasion, when presiding at one of her first
court ceremonials, she took off her gloves, contrary
to all custom and tradition. An elderly court dame
hastened to remind her of her mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I not?&rdquo; inquired the Empress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is against the rules of etiquette,&rdquo; was
the answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then in future let it be proper to break the
rule!&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>No young husband could have been more devoted
than Franz Joseph was to the bride he had
found for himself without the aid of ambassador or
envoy. &ldquo;I am beloved as if I were a lieutenant,
and as happy as a god!&rdquo; he wrote to a friend just
after the wedding.</p>
<p>And Elizabeth did truly love him, but not as he
did her. In spite of the intensity of feeling that
showed itself in after life, there was a certain inborn
coldness in her nature that made it impossible for
her to share his ardor or to understand him always.
But it often taxed his devotion and patience to reconcile
this freedom-loving child of nature to the restraints
and obligations of her new position, and he
was many times called upon to make peace between
the older court ladies and their young mistress.
He would gladly have loosened her bonds somewhat,
but dared not introduce new ways and customs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The Archduchess Sophie had hitherto reigned
supreme at court. She was a remarkably clever
woman, and all through the first difficult years of
her son&rsquo;s reign had proved a valuable support to
him, and acquired an influence which she had no
intention of surrendering into the hands of her
seventeen-year-old niece. Two women, though of
the same blood, could scarcely have been more
different. The Archduchess was ambitious and
worldly; the Empress cared nothing for place or
power. Sophie was completely under the influence
of the priesthood; Elizabeth worshipped God in
nature, but avoided all religious ceremonies and
hated priests. The older woman expected to find
it easy to govern this child who had so unexpectedly
received the imperial crown, through her vanity
and inexperience, but finding herself mistaken,
she resorted to other means. Elizabeth, as we have
seen, had come to Vienna full of hopes and dreams,
expecting naturally to occupy the first place in her
husband&rsquo;s life and court; but every attempt to
assert her right as Empress was deliberately set
aside by the Archduchess, who crushed her hopes
and dispelled her dreams with a cruel hand, regardless
of her feelings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>As for the court, &ldquo;Madame M&egrave;re,&rdquo; as she was
called, was a power whose friendship it was prudent
to possess. It was believed, moreover, that Franz
Joseph, whose fickleness and susceptibility in matters
of the heart were well known, would soon tire
of his young wife. Elizabeth&rsquo;s inexperience made
it impossible for her to battle successfully with
court intrigues, and it was plain that the mother-in-law
would be victorious in the struggle between
them. The Emperor always treated his wife with
the greatest care and consideration, but misunderstandings
gradually arose between them, fostered
by wounded pride on her side and on his by the
Archduchess Sophie&rsquo;s constant efforts to lower her
in the eyes of her son. Dearly as she loved Franz
Joseph, Elizabeth held herself more and more aloof
from him for fear of seeming the troublesome child
her mother-in-law called her, and an expression of
quiet sadness grew upon her. But there were moments,
too, of hot revolt against the cold, selfish
world in which she lived, and these did not mend
matters for her. Rash and thoughtless, she struggled
against this unceasing persecution. She treated
the Archduchess&rsquo; followers with marked disdain and
gave her confidence to others who deceived and
betrayed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Travels and Sorrows</span></h2>
<p>Nothing had been originally farther
from the wishes of the young Empress
than to fill her throne in solitary state,
surrounded only by a few chosen families
of noble birth. What she most wanted was to go
about among the people and get acquainted with her
new subjects, and during the early part of her married
life she was often seen in the streets of Vienna.
Wherever she went crowds gathered, struggling and
pushing good-naturedly to get as near a view of her
as possible. One day she went out to walk, accompanied
only by one of her ladies-in-waiting and
without informing any one of her intention. On
one of the principal squares, seeing something in a
window that attracted her, she entered the shop, but
on turning to go out again was unpleasantly surprised
to find hundreds of faces peering in at the
door and windows, and it was only with the aid of
the police that she was able to reach the street
again. This incident excited the greatest disapproval
at court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Her Majesty seems to imagine herself still in
the mountains of Bavaria. She forgets that she is
the Empress of Austria and what she owes to her
husband&rsquo;s position,&rdquo; was whispered about her.</p>
<p>Discouraged at the result of her attempts to
mingle with the people, she thenceforth avoided
appearing in public as much as possible, confining
her walks to the secluded portions of the palace
gardens or the park about Sch&ouml;nbrunn. But even
this did not satisfy the court, which now found fault
with her for neglecting to show herself before the
people on every possible occasion. This hostility
and opposition that met the young Empress at every
turn only made her retire the more within herself,
and really inflicted an irreparable wrong, for it developed
in her an inherited love of solitude that, once
acquired, soon became too fixed ever to be renounced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the outlying portions of the Empire&mdash;Bohemia,
Moravia, Galicia, and Hungary&mdash;were
waiting anxiously to welcome the imperial pair, and
soon after the wedding they began a series of short
journeys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>In September, 1856, they made a visit to the
Austrian Alps that is still remembered and talked
of even in the remotest mountain valleys. From
Heiligenblut, where they spent the night, the Emperor
and Empress climbed the Grossglockner.
About four o&rsquo; clock in the morning, after hearing
mass in the little parish church, they began the
ascent, accompanied by two experienced guides,
Elizabeth riding part of the way, while her husband
walked. During the walk he gathered a bunch of
edelweiss growing on a steep cliff and handed it to
his wife, saying, &ldquo;This is the first edelweiss I ever
picked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Wallner Hut, as it was then called, the
Empress stopped to rest, while Franz Joseph
climbed to the lofty Glockner-saddle, and it was in
remembrance of this visit that the Wallner Hut
received the name of Elisabeth-ruhe. From there
they went to Steiermark and thence to Gratz,
where they arrived on the eleventh of September,
and where, as at all other places, they were received
with the greatest enthusiasm. In November of the
same year they visited the Italian provinces which
at that time formed part of their dominions. Owing
to the political disturbances of the period and the
feeling of the Italians against Austria, it was feared
the sovereigns would meet with a cold reception;
but the &ldquo;mistress of the Adriatic&rdquo; had decked
herself magnificently to greet the young Empress.
The streets and market-places were brilliantly illuminated
and gorgeous masked balls were given in
her honor. All hearts were won by Elizabeth&rsquo;s
beauty and charm of manner, and the delighted
Emperor said to her:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your smile has done more toward conquering
the people than all my armies have been able to
accomplish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franz Joseph, as we have seen, was a mere youth
when his uncle, the Emperor Ferdinand, abdicated
in his favor and retired to Prague to end his days.
The young sovereign had scarcely ascended the
throne when rebellion broke out in Hungary, and
unable to quell the disturbance alone he was forced
to seek aid from Russia. Czar Nicholas placed one
hundred thousand men at his disposal, and the
revolt of 1848-1849 was crushed with a firm hand.
Countless towns, villages, and estates were laid in
ashes, and the country was left bleeding from almost
incurable wounds. The people bore their hard fate
in sullen defiance, and five years later, when the
Emperor married, time had done little to soften
their hatred of Austria.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The pardon that Franz Joseph had granted on
his wedding day to all political offenders in his
dominions formed one step toward reconciliation,
but the first real signs of a more friendly feeling
were due not to him but to the Queen. It was her
smile that finally appeased the wrath of the Hungarians,
her beauty and goodness that laid the
foundation of more amicable relations between them
and their sovereign. She devoted herself assiduously
to the study of their language, one of the
most difficult in Europe, interested herself in the
art and customs of the country, and showed such
deep concern for their welfare that she is said to
have wept on occasions when her husband refused
to grant their wishes.</p>
<p>The reason for Elizabeth&rsquo;s sudden and strong
attachment to this hitherto unknown country could
have been only a psychological one. When she
first came to Vienna, she was impressed with the
violent prejudice that existed at court against the
Hungarians. Each attempt of that liberty-loving
people to throw off their chains was regarded as a
fresh crime by the Archduchess Sophie and her adherents,
and the Empress heard much harsh criticism
of her subjects beyond the Leytha. Her
natural perversity and independence, however, led
her to investigate the matter for herself, and she
soon gained a very different idea of the open-hearted,
chivalrous Hungarians, whose natural character was
so like her own. Hoping to learn more of the
inner life of the people by means of the language,
she began the study of it with a zeal and industry
that shrank from no difficulties till in time she
acquired perfect mastery of it even to speaking it
like a native.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queen Elizabeth speaks our language without
a trace of foreign accent,&rdquo; said the Hungarian poet,
Maurus J&oacute;kai, &ldquo;speaks it like a peasant woman
and without any of the affectation common with
most of our court ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her first teacher was an old professor named
Homokh, with whom she learned the grammar and
to read easily. But this did not satisfy her. She
wanted a thorough knowledge of Hungarian literature
and engaged as her instructor Dr. Max Falk,
at that time a journalist in Vienna. His methods
were far less tedious than those of Homokh, and
she began to read the best passages of Scripture, together
with a history of the people. He also gave
her for translation into Hungarian the French
correspondence between Joseph Second of Austria
and Catherine Second of Russia, published by
Arnath, a task she found most delightful. Her
tutor was charmed with her enthusiasm and the
accuracy with which she performed her duties as
pupil. One morning as she handed him her written
translation, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day yesterday my time was taken up with
audiences, and in the evening there was a court concert.
After that I was so tired I went directly to
bed, but no sooner had I lain down than I remembered
my Hungarian translation had not been
written. So I tore a leaf from the almanac that lay
on a table beside my bed and did it there. Excuse
the pencil.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>It was not until May, 1857, however, that she
made her first visit to Hungary. Her arrival was
hailed with enthusiasm, and the young Queen was
everywhere greeted with shouts of joy. An extensive
tour of the country had been planned by the
sovereigns, but a sad event forced them to abandon
it.</p>
<p>The Emperor and Empress had two children at
this time, the little Archduchesses Sophie and
Gisela. Scarcely had the court established itself in
the royal palace at Ofen when word was received of
the illness of the two-year-old Sophie. The physicians&rsquo;
first reports were reassuring, but on reaching
Debreczin, May 28, the despatches announced a
change for the worse. The anxious parents hastened
back to Budapest, where on the next evening
they heard that their oldest child was dead.</p>
<p>Elizabeth left Hungary with tears in her eyes.
Her first great sorrow had befallen her on her first
visit among the Magyars, and it may have been
that grief attached her still more closely to this
people whom in after years she loved so well and by
whom she was adored as a sovereign and reverenced
as a guardian angel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Birth of Crown Prince Rudolf</span></h2>
<p>Not only the Emperor and his family but
the whole nation were anxious for an heir
to the throne, and the disappointment
was great when on May 5, 1855, the
Empress gave birth to a daughter, who was called
Sophie Dorothea, after the Emperor&rsquo;s mother.
Elizabeth was too young and inexperienced to
understand this, though she could not fail to read
the evidences of it in the faces of those about her.
Still greater dissatisfaction greeted the birth of a
second daughter, Gisela, in July, 1856. This daughter
was married in 1873 to Prince Leopold of Bavaria,
second son of the present Prince Regent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The Empress looked forward to her maternal
duties with the greatest happiness, and asked nothing
more than to devote herself to her children.
But even this was not to be allowed her. The
Archduchess Sophie had the little girls removed
almost immediately to a remote wing of the Hofburg,
leaving the young mother alone in her splendid
apartments, where she had always felt herself so
much a stranger. Involuntarily she compared her
lot with that of her mother, the mistress of Possenhoffen,
whose busy life was filled with work and
noble sacrifices for her flock of children, while the
Empress of Austria had nothing left her but to
preserve her beauty and exhibit her toilettes. The
importance of providing the Empire with an heir
was impressed upon her so constantly that she was
puzzled and asked her own mother once in a moment
of confidence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should have no son, do you suppose that
Franz would follow Napoleon&rsquo;s example and cause
our marriage to be annulled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not think of such things, my child,&rdquo; replied
the Duchess. &ldquo;You know that Franz loves you
devotedly.&rdquo; Then she continued: &ldquo;There are two
sorts of women in this world,&mdash;those who always
get their own way and those who never get it. You
seem to me to be one of the latter. You have
great abilities and do not lack character. But you
have not the faculty of stooping to the level of
your associates, or adapting yourself to your environment.
You belong to another period, that in
which saints and martyrs existed. Do not attract
notice by being too obviously the first or break
your own heart by fancying yourself the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>At last, shortly before her twenty-first birthday,
her dearest wishes were gratified, and on August 21,
1858, a son was born to the imperial pair, a beautiful
child though somewhat delicate, in whose cradle the
delighted father hastened to lay the Order of the
Golden Fleece.</p>
<p>The next morning the good news was carried by
telegraph to every corner of the world, a salute of a
hundred and one guns was fired from all the fortresses
in Austria and Hungary, and the signal was
echoed from a million throats, while public enthusiasm
was still further increased when the Crown
Prince, at his christening, received the name of his
great ancestor Rudolf of Hapsburg. The popularity
of the Empress was at once restored. Her
enemies were silenced, her mother-in-law contented,
and she herself for a time was happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has seemed to need me until now,&rdquo; she
declared pathetically, &ldquo;not even my little girl whom
they keep from me as much as possible. But I will
not permit my boy to be taken away and given to
the care of strangers. He will need me and we
will be happy in each other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Again, however, she was mistaken. Rudolf was
installed as soon as possible in a remote part of the
palace, the Archduchess insisting that it was not
suitable for the heir to a great empire to be brought
up by a young mother who as yet did not even
know how to conduct herself. When Elizabeth
begged to be allowed the care of her own child and
dwelt on the comfort it would be to her, her
mother-in-law declared indignantly that it was absurd
to talk of the need for comfort when she had
everything in the world to make her happy. From
Sophie&rsquo;s point of view indeed this was perhaps true,
but Elizabeth was of a different stamp, and no outward
luxury could make up to her for disappointed
hopes or an empty heart. Matters grew still worse
for her when in the Summer of 1857 the Emperor&rsquo;s
second brother, Ferdinand Maximilian, married
Charlotte, the daughter of King Leopold First of
Belgium. This aspiring princess attached herself
at once to the court party and became a great
favorite with her mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy clouds were gathering on the
political horizon. Among Franz Joseph&rsquo;s Italian
subjects the ferment was strongest, but throughout
the whole Empire there was great discontent. It
was well known that the Archduchess Sophie held
the reins of power, and that it was she who declared
war or concluded peace,&mdash;a state of things that
caused much opposition in diplomatic circles, while
all classes united in condemning this so-called &ldquo;petticoat
government.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>When the war with France and Sardinia broke
out in 1859, it was less a question of the country&rsquo;s
incontestable rights than of the maintenance of the
power of the Jesuits. Elizabeth plainly saw the mistake
her husband was making in allowing himself
to be guided so much by his mother in political
matters and longed to use her influence with him
to prevent it, but she was powerless. No one asked
her advice, no one cared for her opinion; so she
held her peace. While Franz Joseph was fighting
at Solferino and his mother corresponded with foreign
courts or held long conferences with statesmen
and diplomats, the Empress had to content herself
with visiting wounded soldiers and officers from the
Italian battlefields. Like an angel of mercy she
went about among the hospitals, tasting the food
that had been prepared and distributing money and
cigars. Her gentle words of pity and cheer carried
the more weight since they had none of the sanctimonious
tone so common at that time. The halo
of piety with which the Archduchess Sophie enveloped
all her actions was most distasteful to Elizabeth,
who did not attempt to conceal her dislike of
the clergy.</p>
<p>Once at a court ball, her train became entangled
around the feet of the papal nuncio, who happened
to be standing near. With an angry glance the
Empress jerked it toward her with such force that
the prelate barely escaped a fall,&mdash;a scene that was
the cause of much suppressed merriment, for it was
well known that Her Majesty would quite as gladly
have deprived him of his influence at court as upset
his person in the ball-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Elizabeth&rsquo;s Illness and Sojourn in Madeira</span></h2>
<p>The estrangement between the Emperor
and Empress gradually increased. Affairs
of state, the distractions of court life, together
with Franz Joseph&rsquo;s growing disposition
to return to the habits and pleasures of his
bachelor life, all tended to widen the breach between
them. The Emperor was naturally kind and affectionate,
but he also had weaknesses which on closer
acquaintance proved him to be far from the ideal
character his young wife had imagined. She was
too proud to stoop to unworthy means to retain his
attachment for her, and her increasing sadness and
reserve as well as her disinclination to take part in
the festivities of the court, only wearied and helped
to estrange him the more, as he felt in it a silent
reproach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Elizabeth had expected to find complete happiness
in his love, and her solitary position at court in
an atmosphere so hostile had made her cling yet
more closely to this hope. By this time, however,
reality had dispelled this illusion. She did not feel
that she had lost her power over him or even his
love, but her faith in him was shaken and her confidence
destroyed. To be pitied was unendurable to
the proud daughter of the Wittelsbachs. She hid
her disappointment from the world and retired more
and more within herself. At length her health began
to give way. She struggled bravely against her
growing weakness, but was finally seized with an
illness which her physicians could neither understand
nor cure. After repeated consultations it was
decided that her lungs were affected, and a journey
to Madeira was advised, that place being at the time
regarded as the most favorable one for troubles of
that kind. For a long time she refused to follow
their advice, but finally early in the year 1861 she
consented to go. Those who saw her start doubted
whether she would ever return, and she herself had
little hope of regaining her health.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>She left Europe wrapped in mist and cold.
When she landed in Madeira, a week later, she was
greeted by blue skies, brilliant sunshine, and tropical
vegetation. The villa she was to occupy was
charmingly situated, with wide verandas, terraces
overlooking the sea, and a chain of mountains
stretching behind it. Under these new conditions
the Empress began at once to improve and by the
first of March was able to make daily excursions
about the island, which was now ablaze with flowers.
She even grew to look upon her illness as a deliverer.
It had enabled her to escape from the
oppression of court life, and the quiet solitude
taught her patience and gave her strength to bear
the trials still in store for her. She lived over
the struggles of her life at Vienna, so different
from the happy days of childhood in her peaceful
Bavarian home, the memory of which, together
with the tales and legends she had heard at her
father&rsquo;s knee, returned so often and so vividly to
her mind.</p>
<p>She rose early every morning, studied, and practised
her music, wrote daily letters to her husband
and her parents, and took long walks upon the
shore. Once during her stay on the island she had
a visit from her sister Helene, who had married the
Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Vessels rarely stopped
there, and her life was most uneventful; but nature,
which she had always loved, now became doubly
dear. It was there too that she discovered a new
interest in the world of poetry, and books soon
became like friends to her. In the long solitary
evenings she would take refuge in them from the
restless longings of her heart and forget for the time
her cares and troubles. Meanwhile, in Vienna, news
of the Empress&rsquo; death was daily expected, but instead
came word that her cough grew better, and at
last it was announced that the climate of Madeira
had done its work and she would be allowed to
come back after a stay of four months.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>On the way home in the middle of May a frightful
storm arose, and the yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i>
(which had been loaned her by Queen Victoria of
England for the return voyage) was tossed about
like a nutshell on the angry sea. The Empress,
however, refused to leave the deck in spite of all
entreaties and the mountainous waves that threatened
to sweep her over the side of the vessel. She
even had herself fastened to the mast that she
might safely enjoy the wonderful spectacle. On the
eighteenth of May she was met off Trieste by the
Emperor, who had come out on a warship to welcome
her with an escort of five steamboats carrying
notables and citizens with bands of music. At ten
o&rsquo;clock a shot from the castle announced the approach
of the flotilla, and amid thundering salutes
from batteries and warships the Emperor and Empress
entered the harbor and landed near Miramar,
the pleasure palace built for Archduke Maximilian,
afterward Emperor of Mexico. A celebrated
painting depicts the meeting between the young
Archduchess Charlotte and Elizabeth on the great
marble terrace overlooking the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>At Baden Elizabeth saw her mother-in-law and
children again, and five days later the imperial pair
entered Vienna, the railway station of which was
decorated with flowers in honor of the occasion.
They drove to the palace in an open carriage amid
the cheers of the populace, whose joy over the Empress&rsquo;
recovery found further expression the following
day in praise services held in all the churches
of the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Empress&rsquo; Flight from Vienna</span></h2>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s sojourn in Madeira did
not bring the permanent improvement
that was hoped for. A few weeks after
her return to Austria the cough returned,
and fearing that the nature of her illness had been
mistaken, her parents&rsquo; physician who had had the
care of her in her youth was sent for. He decided
that she was suffering from acute indigestion
and that a change was imperative. This time the
place of resort chosen was the island of Corfu,
where she arrived safely soon afterward, accompanied
by her physician. The Empress was
charmed with the villa that had been secured for
her, about half an hour&rsquo;s drive from the capital. It
was surrounded with gardens and large grounds,
and in a shorter time even than at Madeira she
began to show the beneficial effects of the climate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Not far from the house was the mountain Aja
Kyriahi, on the summit of which stood a small
church surrounded with cypresses. Every morning
before sunrise she climbed to this spot, and
whenever in after years she came back to Corfu
she always visited it.</p>
<p>At the end of two months her health was quite
restored, and toward the close of October she left
for Venice, where she held her court that Winter.
Her return to Vienna the following August, after a
sojourn in the Tyrol, was the occasion for almost as
much enthusiasm as on her wedding day, the people
everywhere showing the most touching proofs of
their sympathy and devotion.</p>
<p>But again her stay in Vienna was destined to be
of short duration, for after the lapse of a few weeks,
unexpectedly and without confiding her intentions
to any one, she left the capital, to seek refuge in
travel from the troubles and complications of her
position there. The Emperor followed to try and
bring about a reconciliation, but she refused to
meet him, and he returned at length to Vienna
weary and disheartened. With her capacity for
loving and her pride Elizabeth must have suffered
intensely from the slights and disappointments of
her married life, and fresh persecutions on the part
of her mother-in-law, who had already succeeded in
estranging her husband and children from her, no
doubt led her to this step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Months went by, and still the Empress continued
her wanderings. There was a general feeling of
sympathy for the Emperor, but in spite of this
many began to take the part of his young wife, and
when the Archduchess Sophie condemned her too
harshly, believed that had it not been for &ldquo;Madame
M&egrave;re,&rdquo; her daughter-in-law would never have gone
away. The estrangement lasted for several years,
but Elizabeth, at the urgent entreaties not only of
the court but of her own family, agreed to return to
Vienna once or twice a year to fulfil the state duties
required of her. She remained no longer than necessary,
however. The joys of travel had become too
dear to her, the constraints of court life too irksome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Franz Joseph meanwhile was growing more and
more unreconciled to this state of affairs. The
health of the Crown Prince was causing some anxiety,
and his Majesty was urged to make his peace
with the Empress. Elizabeth accordingly was approached
by her mother, the Duchess Ludovica,
for whose opinion she had the greatest respect,
and who finally convinced her that it was her duty
to go back to her children. Time and loneliness
too had softened the bitterness of her feelings
and awakened a mutual desire for reconciliation.
Outside events also helped to bring about the reunion.
Misfortune had overtaken Austria: the
war of 1866 had driven the Hapsburgs from Italy
and Germany, and Elizabeth, roused to sympathy,
turned her face homeward, feeling that her place
was with the Emperor and his people. Though
still young in years her sorrows and trials had
robbed her of her youth, and she came back a
woman strong and self-reliant, caring little for court
life, but devoting herself to hospital work among
the wounded soldiers with an energy and self-sacrifice
that earned her the reverence of all. Day
after day she spent at the bedsides of the suffering,
speaking to each in his own language and seeking to
satisfy his wants. One man, named Joseph Feher,
had refused to have his arm amputated, but the
Empress begged him so earnestly to consent to the
operation that he finally yielded, and she wrote to
his mother that she would have her son taken to
the palace of Laxenburg and provide for his future.
Another day she came upon a soldier whose head
had been so nearly severed that the physicians had
no hope of saving him. Sitting down beside him,
she asked if he had any last requests that she might
fulfil for him. In a faltering voice he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I have had the happiness of seeing the
Empress at my death-bed, there is nothing left to
wish for in this world. I die happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wherever she appeared the weakest tried to lift
themselves at her approach. Arms were outstretched
to touch her as she passed, and when
she left, there was a general murmur of&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless our Elizabeth!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Coronation in Hungary</span></h2>
<p>Again the Archduchess Sophie&rsquo;s schemes
for the house of Hapsburg proved disastrous,
and Franz Joseph&rsquo;s eyes were
opened at last to the fact that her sway
had been as unfortunate for the country as it was
fatal to his domestic happiness. In these bitter
days of defeat and humiliation he learned to value
the Empress at her true worth. She now became
his real companion. In the latter years of her life
he often consulted her in regard to affairs of state,
and she might have exercised a much greater power
in politics had she so desired. But the only matter
of government in which she ever cared to have a
voice was in regard to Hungary, in whose welfare
she always felt the deepest interest. After the
Austrian losses in 1866 she once said to Count
Julius Andrassy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It distresses me to have things go wrong in
Italy, but if anything were to happen to Hungary
it would kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>One Summer while visiting some baths, she
climbed a near-by mountain on the summit of
which a small chalet had been built. As they entered,
her companion, seeing a visitor&rsquo;s book on the
table, wrote in it &ldquo;Elizabeth, Empress of Austria.&rdquo;
Thereupon her mistress drew off her gloves and,
taking the pen, added in Hungarian, &ldquo;Elizabeth,
Queen of Hungary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mutual attachment proved a valuable safeguard
during the war of 1866, when the Prussians
threatened to advance on Vienna. It was thought
safest for Elizabeth and the little Crown Prince to
retire to Budapest, where she was received with an
enthusiasm little short of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s memorable
reception. There is no doubt that the devotion
of the people to the Queen was largely instrumental
in bringing about a better feeling between Austria
and Hungary, while still another proof of this devotion
was their special request that she might be
crowned together with the King, an event that had
never before occurred in the history of the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>It was not until the eighth of June, 1867, however,
that the coronation took place. The ancient
city of Pressburg had been the scene of all former
coronations, but on this occasion the ceremonies
were to be held for the first time in Ofen and Pesth,
or Budapest, as it is now called, which had been made
the capital in 1848. The city is one of the most
beautifully situated in all Europe. On an almost
perpendicular rock stands the royal castle, an
imposing structure of great antiquity, and at its foot,
surrounding it on three sides, lies Ofen. The flat
and more modern town of Pesth is to the left, and
beyond it extend boundless plains.</p>
<p>Both cities were in gala attire to welcome the
sovereigns. In every direction as far as the eye
could reach was a sea of waving flags and pennants,
and on the spire of the Rathshaus gleamed a huge
crown of St. Stephen. The evening before the ceremony
was to take place Franz Joseph and his wife
made a visit to the cathedral, which had been
magnificently decorated for the occasion, and were
greeted everywhere with the wildest enthusiasm.
As they were about to leave the church an old
man fell from a ladder on which he had perched
himself in order to obtain a view of &ldquo;the good
Queen of Hungary.&rdquo; Elizabeth, who saw him fall,
hastened at once to his assistance,&mdash;an act that
called forth renewed cheers when it reached the
ears of those outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>The town was crowded with Magyars from all
parts of the kingdom, and sixty thousand troops
lined the streets from the railway station to the
royal castle, a distance of six kilometres. It was a
most brilliant sight as the procession wound slowly
down from the castle and crossed the bridge. Franz
Joseph made a stately and imposing figure in his
crown and coronation robes, but Elizabeth was the
centre of all eyes. The sides of the coach were of
glass so that she could be seen from all directions.
It was surmounted by a large crown and drawn by
six magnificent white horses, their long manes and
tails interwoven with gold. Elizabeth at this time
was in the prime of her majestic loveliness, having
not yet reached her thirtieth year, and was considered
the most beautiful princess in the whole
civilized world. Deafening &ldquo;Eljens&rdquo; greeted her
all the way to the cathedral, cannon thundered, and
white-clad maidens showered roses in her path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Immediately behind the Queen followed a mounted
escort of two hundred young nobles in the gorgeous
costume of the Hungarian magnate, covered with
gold and precious stones. Their reins and stirrups
were similarly adorned, and over the left shoulder
they wore a leopard skin. The King and his suite
had already taken their places in the cathedral when
the Queen entered. She wore a dress of white brocaded
satin and a black velvet bodice covered with
diamonds. The coronation robe was also of black
velvet, bordered with white satin. About her neck
was a Hungarian necklace of diamonds, and on her
head she wore the Hapsburg coronet that had been
made originally for Maria Theresa. It is composed
entirely of pearls and diamonds and is valued at three
million gulden. While the King was being crowned,
she remained seated with clasped hands absorbed in
prayer, after which she in turn went through her
part of the ceremony. As she resumed her place
upon the throne beside the Emperor with orb and
sceptre in hand, the whole assemblage joined in a
mighty Te Deum which re-echoed from the vaulted
roof of the old church.</p>
<p>The coronation ceremonies and the enthusiasm
with which she was everywhere received made such
an impression upon Elizabeth that she could never
afterward speak of them without emotion and always
regarded the occasion as one of the happiest
times of her life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Archduchess Marie Valerie</span></h2>
<p>The years following the coronation in
Hungary were without doubt among the
happiest of the Empress Elizabeth&rsquo;s life.
She interested herself in the details of her
children&rsquo;s education, shared her husband&rsquo;s occupations
and anxieties, and resumed her place at court
with a dignity and loftiness of purpose that completely
silenced her enemies. Conditions too had
changed. The Archduchess Sophie had not only
ceased to be a ruling power, but was completely
crushed by the death of her second son, Maximilian,
in Mexico, where he had been condemned to death
and shot in 1867, after he had reluctantly accepted
the throne. His unhappy wife, whose ambition was
partly responsible for these tragic events, became
hopelessly insane and it fell to Elizabeth&rsquo;s lot to
support and comfort the grief-stricken family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The following year, April 22, 1868, another
daughter was born to the imperial pair at the royal
castle at Ofen. It was the first time for a century
that a child of the royal house had been born in
Hungary, and the enthusiasm of the Magyars knew
no bounds. All night the streets were filled with
excited throngs shouting &ldquo;Eljens&rdquo; for the King
and Queen and the new-born Princess.</p>
<p>The Archduchess Marie Valerie, as she was
christened, became the Empress&rsquo; favorite child.
The two older ones had been kept away from her
so long that at first they were completely estranged
and it required much patience and devotion on
her part to gain their affection and confidence.
The Crown Prince, who was ten years old at that
time, was a most interesting child and already a universal
favorite, but under his grandmother&rsquo;s influence
he had developed a mixture of wayward pride
and vanity that troubled his mother greatly and
which she strove hard to correct. Fortunately,
however, Rudolf was tender-hearted and easily influenced,
and she succeeded at last to a large extent
in overcoming the evil effects of the adulation and
flattery with which the little heir had been surrounded.
With Valerie she determined it should
be different, and from earliest babyhood her training
and education became the Empress&rsquo; chief care.
She was a delicate child, and the mother watched
over her with a devotion that seemed almost like a
reparation for what she had failed to give her other
children. She was present at the lessons of the two
elder ones whenever possible and took the greatest
interest in their education, repeatedly impressing on
their teachers that she did not want them favored
or spoiled. She taught the little girls to dance,
and the first dance that Valerie learned was the
Hungarian Czardas. She tried to implant in them
her own love for Hungary and urged their tutors
and governesses &ldquo;to make them as little German as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Christmas was the most joyful time in the year
for the imperial family, and Christmas Eve, being
also Elizabeth&rsquo;s birthday, was celebrated as a double
feast. There were always two trees, the smaller of
which the Empress decorated with her own hands
for the children. She spent days looking for appropriate
gifts for them and the Emperor, as well as
the various members of the court, whose individual
tastes she always tried to gratify. One day, shortly
before Christmas, Marie Valerie came to her mother
with a beseeching air and begged that the presents
intended for her might be given to some poor children.
Much touched by the idea, Elizabeth consented,
and from that time there was always another
tree laden with gifts for the unfortunates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The Empress adored flowers. During her rambles
she would gather whole armfuls, and even when
riding would often spring from her horse to pick
wild flowers and fasten them to the pommel of her
saddle. Her rooms were always filled with them,
and if any choice blossom chanced to please her
especially she would carry it at night into her own
bedroom. &ldquo;Mutzerl,&rdquo; as Marie Valerie was called,
inherited this passion of her mother&rsquo;s, and almost
as soon as she could walk she started little gardens
of her own at the different places where the court
stayed in turn. She was her mother&rsquo;s constant
companion and there was the most touching sympathy
and devotion between them. &ldquo;Valerie is not
only a daughter to me,&rdquo; Elizabeth once said, &ldquo;but
my best friend and companion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The Archduchess was remarkable for her simplicity
and lack of self-consciousness, as well as for
her dignity and kindness of heart. Elizabeth was
a firm believer in the virtues of physical exercise
and had her daughter taught to ride, fence, and
shoot; but Valerie did not altogether share her love
of long walks and rides. She had the Wittelsbach
love of art and literature, was devoted to poetry and
even as a child wrote verses of some merit. Remembering
the mortifications her own lack of education
had caused her in her early married life, the
Empress took special interest in Valerie&rsquo;s education.
She had her taught Latin and Greek, besides several
modern languages, and shared her studies as
much as possible, often poring over some difficult
passage in Greek Scripture with her or learning by
heart the most beautiful verses. The young poetess
looked upon her mother as her most valuable critic
and showed her all her poems which filled several
volumes, deferring always to the Empress&rsquo; judgment
and finding in her praise her greatest reward.
She was devoted to both her parents, but as time
went on became almost a second self to her mother&mdash;the
living token of the reconciliation between
herself and the Emperor, and a consolation for
all her loneliness and suffering.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Castle of G&ouml;d&ouml;ll&ouml;</span></h2>
<p>Not long after their wedding the Emperor
and Empress visited an exhibition of
paintings in Vienna. Franz Joseph was
anxious to purchase some of them, but
left the choice entirely to his wife, who went back
accordingly a few days later with one of her ladies
and selected twenty-four, every one of which when
sent to the palace proved to be of horses. Both at
the Hofburg and at Sch&ouml;nbrunn her chief interest
was in the imperial stables, where she spent most
of her mornings trying different mounts. She loved
exercise of all kinds, but riding was her greatest delight
and her skill and daring as a horsewoman were
remarkable. Authorities in these matters have declared
that she outshone any rider of her own sex,
for she had a singular, almost hypnotic power over
horses, and even the most vicious ones would allow
her to approach and stroke them. Her slender
wrists were like steel, and there was no horse she
could not ride when once she had made up her mind
to do so. Fear and fatigue were alike unknown to
her, and she used often to terrify the director of the
riding-school in Vienna by asking him to send her
one or two of his wildest specimens to try. A
cavalry officer once expressed his surprise to the
Emperor at his allowing the Empress of Austria
to spend so much time in the stables and make
companions of jockeys and circus riders. &ldquo;Ah,
my young friend,&rdquo; replied the Emperor kindly,
&ldquo;it is evident you do not know women. They
usually do as they please without waiting for our
permission.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Elizabeth never appeared to better advantage
than when on horseback. Her habit, which seemed
as if moulded to her figure, was usually dark blue,
trimmed with fur. She also wore a low round hat
and heavy riding-gloves, but never a flower or bow or
anything superfluous except a black fan, which she
carried in her hand or hung by a strap to her saddle.
Strangers generally supposed this was to protect her
complexion, but her friends were well aware that it
was merely to guard herself from the inevitable photographers
who pursued her everywhere. &ldquo;I hate
being photographed,&rdquo; she once declared: &ldquo;every
time in my life that I have been, something dreadful
has happened to me.&rdquo; She liked to attend to
her horses personally and visited them every morning,
taking sugar and carrots in her pocket for them,
sometimes even going into their stalls to pet or rub
them down. At Sch&ouml;nbrunn she had a room the
walls of which were completely covered with pictures
of horses. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she once said to her Greek
teacher when showing him this room, &ldquo;all these are
friends I have lost. Many of them have died for
me, which is more than I can say of any human
being. People would far rather have me killed.&rdquo;
She was never so happy as when in the saddle, dashing
through the forests of Austria or the wide Hungarian
plains. But these long rides also served
another purpose. On both sides of the house she
had relatives whose lives were darkened by the fatal
inheritance of the Wittelsbachs; so it was not
strange that as she grew older her sensitive nature
should have brooded over the fear of developing the
family disorder. To banish these terrible fits of depression
she would gallop for hours, insensible to
weather or physical exhaustion, sometimes drenched
to the skin, and it was only when she felt her horse
quiver under her with fatigue that she would slacken
her pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Immediately after the coronation the Hungarians
presented to their Queen the castle of G&ouml;d&ouml;ll&ouml;,
situated in the depths of the forest, not far from
Budapest, and for many years it was her favorite
residence. Here there was nothing to break
the peaceful seclusion but the plaintive notes of
the Zingaris&rsquo; violins. Here she was her own
mistress, spending long, happy, care-free days.
She usually rose at four o&rsquo;clock, and was in the
saddle from five till eleven, when she breakfasted.
It was an ideal country for riding, and she became
familiar with every forest pathway for miles
around, often stopping at some camp of the Czikos
to chat with these half-savage Bedouins of the
Hungarian Puszta, in whom she felt the greatest
interest. She brought them gifts of tobacco, and
was always welcomed with delight by these strange
herdsmen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>But there were gay times also at G&ouml;d&ouml;ll&ouml; in those
days, when her husband and children were there
and the castle was full of guests. Her stag hunts
were famous, and the walls were covered with trophies
of the chase. &ldquo;There is a tree at G&ouml;d&ouml;ll&ouml;,&rdquo;
she once said to a companion, &ldquo;who is one of my
best friends. He knows all my inmost thoughts,
and whenever I go back there I tell him all that
has happened to me since we parted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Wherever she might be her thoughts turned longingly
toward her beloved Hungary, where she was
happiest, and among whose romantic, impulsive
people she always felt most at home. All classes
in Budapest adored their beautiful Queen, who
wore the national costume of the country and lost
no opportunity of remaining among them. Her
courage, gentleness, and open-hearted generosity
made her universally beloved. She would go about
among the poorest and vilest quarters of the city,
helping the suffering and needy, quite unconscious
of danger or fear. The wretched creatures often
little suspected who she was, but she was welcomed
everywhere as an angel of mercy, and could
go unharmed where even the police would scarcely
venture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>One evening she was riding with a companion
through the outskirts of Budapest, and was just
passing a hovel set back a little from the main road
when they were startled by hearing piercing shrieks
from within. The voice was that of a woman evidently
in the greatest distress. On the impulse of
the moment they leaped from their horses, and rushing
to the door and bursting it open, found themselves
in a low, dirty room, where a huge ruffian of
a man was dragging a woman about the floor by her
long, unbound hair, kicking her vigorously as he
did so. Without a moment&rsquo;s thought Elizabeth
dealt him a blow in the face with her heavy hunting-crop,
which so surprised the fellow that he dropped
his victim and stared at her in blank amazement.
Elizabeth&rsquo;s own astonishment was still greater, however,
when the ill-used woman arose and sprang at
her like a tiger, overwhelming her at the same time
with the vilest abuse for presuming to attack her
husband. The Empress burst into a peal of laughter,
and taking a gold piece from her pocket she
handed it to the man, exclaiming: &ldquo;Beat her, my
friend. Beat her all she wants; she deserves it for
being so loyal to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Empress in Vienna</span></h2>
<p>The year 1873 was a memorable one to
Franz Joseph and Elizabeth. Their
eldest daughter, Gisela, was married,
April 20, to Prince Leopold of Bavaria
in the Church of the Augustins, where the imperial
pair had celebrated their union nineteen years before.
The bride was led to the altar by her mother
and left that same afternoon with her husband for
Munich. The Viennese overwhelmed the Archduchess
with gifts and entertainments, and the streets
were lined with crowds eager to witness the departure
of the young couple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>A few days afterward, May 1, 1873, the Emperor
and Empress opened the World&rsquo;s Exposition at
Vienna, an event that was celebrated with all sorts
of festivities and made the occasion of a perfect
jubilee. The Exhibition was a great success as well
as a source of pride to Austria, as it demonstrated
what the country could accomplish in the way of
arts and manufactures in a comparatively short
space of time. Many of the crowned heads of
Europe came as guests to the capital. The old
Emperor William and his clever wife Augusta visited
at the Hofburg and Sch&ouml;nbrunn; Czar Alexander
Second of Russia and King Victor Emmanuel
of Italy also came, as did the Shah of Persia and
many others.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, cared little for people of her
own rank. &ldquo;Titles mean nothing,&rdquo; she declared;
&ldquo;they are only the trappings with which we try to
hide our nakedness; they do not change our real
selves.&rdquo; Little to her taste as court ceremonies
were, she bore her part in them with ease and
dignity and was always the centre of interest and
admiration wherever she went. Some years before
the fall of the French Empire, the Austrian sovereigns
met Napoleon and Eug&eacute;nie at Salzburg. The
French Empress was then at the zenith of her
beauty, but Elizabeth with her glorious eyes and
hair and the wonderful charm of her personality
did not suffer by comparison with the Spaniard
nor even with younger princesses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>In 1873 the twenty-fifth anniversary of Franz
Joseph&rsquo;s accession to the throne was celebrated with
great rejoicings, the festivities culminating in the
evening by the triumphal progress of the imperial
pair with the Crown Prince through the streets
of Vienna, which were brilliantly illuminated and
decorated and filled with cheering throngs. But even
on this occasion it was evident Elizabeth found it
an effort to appear in public, and she avoided the
noise and confusion as much as possible. Her
growing reserve and dislike of self-display were
taken as a personal offence by the spectacle-loving
Viennese and added to her unpopularity. She was
considered cold and proud and was taxed with heartlessness
and indifference, a fact of which she was
well aware and which only added to her melancholy.</p>
<p>She adored children, rich and poor alike, and at
the close of the Vienna Exposition took into her
service a little Berber boy named Mahmoud, who
had acted as page in the Cairene house erected in
the Prater by the Khedive of Egypt and afterward
presented to the Empress. Mahmoud adored his
mistress and she was exceedingly kind to him.
When the climate of Vienna affected his lungs and
he fell ill with pneumonia, she nursed and tended
him herself, and he became the favorite playmate
of the Archduchess Valerie, greatly to the horror of
the Austrian aristocracy. Patience was not one
of the Wittelsbach virtues, and so many false and
cruel reports were circulated about her in Vienna by
careless tongues that when Elizabeth was informed
of the indignation she had aroused by her kindness
to Mahmoud she responded by having the two children
photographed together and the picture displayed
in public. This act of defiance naturally added to
the number of her detractors, and many even began
to hint that the Empress&rsquo; restlessness and eccentricities
were certain signs of approaching insanity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>But there was still another reason for the Empress&rsquo;
unpopularity in the Austrian capital. Her
husband&rsquo;s German subjects keenly felt her lack of
sympathy with them and resented her unconcealed
preference for Hungary. It was even rumored that
she intended to bestow all her Austrian possessions
upon the Magyars, but this was a rank injustice to
Elizabeth, for throughout the Empire, Austria as
well as Hungary, there was scarcely a charitable institution
or cause that she did not aid or support,
nor a case of suffering and need that she did not
attempt to relieve. When Austria took possession
of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, the Empress
found a fresh field for her energies in caring for the
wounded soldiers and providing for the families of
those who were killed; and when cholera and smallpox
broke out in Budapest, she insisted upon accompanying
the Emperor, who was obliged to go
there for the opening of the National Assembly,
declaring that in time of danger her place was at her
husband&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>In 1879 Franz Joseph and Elizabeth celebrated
their silver wedding, an occasion not unmixed with
sadness to them both, as they looked back on the
trials and disappointments of their married life.
They had requested that there should be no public
observance of the day, and that the sums contributed
for that purpose should be given to charity. An
exception to this was made, however, in Vienna,
where a great ovation had been prepared for the imperial
pair. On the spot where the Emperor had
been attacked by Libeny, the Hungarian, a church
had been erected to commemorate his fortunate
escape, and this was to be formally dedicated as part
of the ceremonies of the day. The city was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>,
and crowds had gathered to salute the Emperor and
Empress as they drove to and from the church.
There was little in their appearance to suggest the
storms that had shaken their lives, for Franz Joseph
was still in the prime of his manhood and Elizabeth
the youngest and most beautiful of grandmothers
(her eldest daughter Gisela had several children at
that time). The festivities, which lasted several
days, concluded on the twenty-seventh of April
with an historical pageant, arranged by the celebrated
painter Hans Makart and carried out on the most
magnificent scale. Every class, institution, and province
in the kingdom was represented, and the various
groups costumed with historical accuracy, the
whole procession making a most imposing spectacle
as it moved slowly along the Ringstrasse amid the
deafening cheers of the spectators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Marriage of Crown Prince Rudolf</span></h2>
<p>Both Franz Joseph and Elizabeth were
very proud of their only son, whose winning
ways and kindness of heart had made
him wonderfully popular with all classes.
He had inherited his mother&rsquo;s impatience of restraint
as well as her literary and artistic tastes, and,
like her, cared little for people of his own rank.
His own intimate circle was composed of poets, artists,
and journalists, and he had an enthusiastic
friend and teacher in the celebrated naturalist,
Brehm. According to the custom of Austrian
princes, he had been required to learn some trade
and chose that of printing, but he possessed a
marked talent for writing and published several
books of real merit. He adored his mother, and
the relation between them was one of the closest
confidence and intimacy, but Elizabeth&rsquo;s love for
her son did not blind her to his faults, and she fully
realized that he had all his father&rsquo;s youthful susceptibility
and love of pleasure. Both she and the
Emperor were agreed as to the necessity of his
marrying early, not only to insure the succession,
but also because they hoped it would steady the
rather wild and headstrong young prince. Franz
Joseph, however, had political advantages most in
mind in the choice of a wife for his son, while Elizabeth
was chiefly concerned as to his prospects of
domestic happiness. She felt the importance of his
marrying some one with sufficient beauty and intelligence
to restrain his somewhat errant fancy and
win his respect as well as affection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>There were but few marriageable princesses in
Europe at that time (Rudolf was then in his twentieth
year), and the Emperor&rsquo;s choice was far from
satisfactory to Elizabeth, for it fell on the Belgian
princess Stephanie, a seventeen-year-old girl of very
ordinary mind and not at all attractive in appearance.
Elizabeth had no liking either for King
Leopold Second of Belgium or his wife, an Austrian
archduchess, who played rather an unenviable role
at her husband&rsquo;s court, and bitterly opposed the
match; but the Queen&rsquo;s sister, the Archduchess Elizabeth
(mother of the Queen Regent of Spain and a
favorite cousin of the Emperor&rsquo;s) brought all her
influence to bear in her niece&rsquo;s favor, and the Empress&rsquo;
objections were overruled, Rudolf himself,
meanwhile, seeming to regard the whole affair with
perfect indifference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The wedding took place May 10, 1881. All
through the festivities that preceded the great event
Elizabeth played her part perfectly as mother of the
bridegroom, though her cold and distant manner
toward her future daughter-in-law as well as the
King and Queen of Belgium was only too evident.
Part of the ceremonies consisted of a state procession
through the streets of the capital, and during
the whole progress she hardly spoke once to Queen
Henriette, who rode beside her, but sat erect, bowing
continuously in acknowledgment of the cheers
of the populace, with a look almost of absentmindedness
on her lovely face. In the middle of
the marriage ceremony her self-control gave way
completely, however, and she burst into a violent
fit of weeping. This was her last public appearance
in Vienna.</p>
<p>Gay, frivolous, and fond of admiration, Stephanie
was a princess to please the taste of the Viennese.
Her arrival at court was hailed with delight, and
when on the third of September, 1883, a daughter
was born to the young couple, the public enthusiasm
was a proof of their popularity. A change in the
relations of Rudolf and his mother after his marriage
was inevitable. Though he continued to make
her his confidante, she was not long in discovering
that he was far from happy in his marriage.
Wretched over this unfortunate state of affairs and
feeling less at home than ever in the Hofburg, she
now rarely visited Vienna, sometimes spending only
a few weeks there in the winter.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="caption"><i>CROWN PRINCE RUDOLF</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>She had never liked the Hofburg nor Sch&ouml;nbrunn,
where the Emperor always spent the spring
months, and now determined to have a residence of
her own somewhere in the neighborhood of the capital.
The spot chosen was the beautiful park of
Lainz, hidden from the public gaze by high stone
walls and further protected by a thick, impenetrable
hedge surrounding the gardens. During the two
years that &ldquo;Waldesruhe,&rdquo; as she called the Schloss,
was being built it was rigidly guarded from intrusion
of any kind, and even after it was finished no one
but the servants and the family were allowed to enter
the park or gardens. The building itself is in the
style of the Renaissance, the <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i> adorned with balconies
and terraces which in the Empress&rsquo; time were
always a mass of flowers. A wide marble staircase
covered with red velvet carpet led to the first floor,
which contained the apartments of the Emperor and
Empress, connected by a great salon or reception
hall. Elizabeth&rsquo;s spacious sleeping chamber was on
the corner, with two windows to the east and two
tall ones to the south, giving upon a balcony. The
bed was placed in the centre of the room, protected
at the head by a large screen, upon the reverse side
of which was a painting of the Virgin Mary. A
figure also representing the Blessed Virgin stood in
one corner, holding in her hands a magnificent
antique rosary. Opposite the bed was an exquisite
statue of Niobe, the pedestal buried in growing
plants and lighted with green incandescent lamps so
arranged that as the Empress lay in bed she could
see no light in the room but the green glimmer that
fell on the Niobe. Breakfast was served on the balcony,
which was like a flower garden. Here too in
later years she placed a favorite work of art, a small
reproduction of the marble statue of Heine made by
the Danish sculptor Hasselriis for her villa Achilleon
at Corfu. Adjoining her bedchamber and also
giving upon the balcony was the Empress&rsquo; study,
filled with photographs of her family and friends,
and a picturesque litter of casts, sketches, bronzes,
souvenirs of travel, and porcelain vases filled with
flowers. Over the great square writing-table hung
a striking portrait of her cousin King Ludwig Second
of Bavaria. A fire was always burning on the wide
hearth, and the Emperor and Empress used often to
sit there together in the evenings watching the glowing
logs and talking over the events of the day.
The guest chambers and apartments of the Archduchess
Marie Valerie were on the floor below, as
was the Empress&rsquo; gymnasium. Physical exercise
was so necessary to her that she always had a room
fitted up in this way wherever she happened to be
staying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Another favorite retreat of Elizabeth&rsquo;s was Miramar,
the Emperor Maximilian&rsquo;s palace, where for
several years after his death she used to make frequent
visits. Built of the purest white marble, it
stands on a rocky promontory overlooking the sea,
and near by is the pavilion used as a residence
by the Empress Charlotte when she returned from
Mexico a widow and hopelessly insane.</p>
<p>At the time Elizabeth was first sent to Corfu to
recuperate, the beauty of the country made a deep
impression upon her, and her love for the shores
of Greece after repeated visits in later years decided
her to build a villa upon the island, the planning
and furnishing of which should reflect her own individual
taste. Near the idyllic village of Gasturi
accordingly there rose the masterpiece of architecture
which she called Achilleon. It stands on a
hill facing the sea, the slopes of which are covered
with olive and lemon trees and laid out as gardens
on wide terraces. The house contains one hundred
and twenty-eight rooms, filled with treasures of
Greek and Pompeian art, and there are accommodations
in the stables for fifty horses. All the rooms
are filled with classic treasures. The Empress&rsquo; own
apartments were entirely apart from the rest of the
building, with a private entrance so that she could
come and go at will. She used to rise at five and
after her bath would go for a walk, usually alone,
with a book under her arm. The mornings were
devoted to study, the afternoons to long rambles.
She knew every road for miles about, but loved best
to explore the steepest and most dangerous mountain
paths, the silent grandeur and beauty of the
heights seeming to soothe for a time the restless
cravings of her spirit. At nine she would retire
after another bath in the marble basin which was
brought from the Villa Borghese in Rome. Heine&rsquo;s
Book of Songs was always under her pillow, and
often she would rise in the middle of the night,
unable to sleep, and wander about through the dark
avenues. At Achilleon, as elsewhere, she was most
anxious to escape observation, and a high wall of
marble with a screen of olive trees hid the palace
from the public gaze. It was not people, however,
that she disliked so much as being the object of
their curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I ask of people,&rdquo; she often said, &ldquo;is that
they will leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>She was always kind and gracious to the poor,
and the peasants used to kneel in the dust before
her when she approached, calling aloud in their
melodious language, &ldquo;O Queen of Beauty, may
God bless thine every step!&rdquo; All heads were uncovered
when she passed, and the children who
watched for her coming would run to meet her with
their hands full of blossoming orange and almond
boughs. On the heights above Achilleon stood a
monastery where she often used to go and talk
with the monks. She asked one of them once if
he ever went to the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always the marketing to do,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Man is but human, and the body suffers
from cold or hunger; but except for that, what
should one do in the village? It is far better and
more beautiful up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the Empress; &ldquo;undoubtedly
you have chosen the better part.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">King Ludwig Second of Bavaria</span></h2>
<p>Through all her sorrows and troubles
Elizabeth never lost her love for her
Bavarian home or for her own family,
with whom she corresponded regularly.
For many years she was in the habit of spending
part of every summer at Possenhoffen, revisiting the
scenes of her childhood and going about among her
peasant friends, who always spoke of her as &ldquo;our
Empress,&rdquo; forgetful of the fact that this title properly
belonged to the Queen of Prussia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The years had brought many sorrows and misfortunes
to Duke Max Joseph and his wife. Their
oldest son married an actress of doubtful reputation.
The Princess of Thurn and Taxis early lost her
husband and oldest child and was left with the burden
of managing the vast family estates. The third
daughter, Marie, like Elizabeth, was elevated to a
throne at the age of seventeen, by becoming the
wife of Francis Second, King of the Two Sicilies;
but barely a year later Garibaldi&rsquo;s freelances robbed
her unworthy husband of his crown and made her
a queen without a country. A scarcely happier fate
befell her sister Mathilde, who was married at eighteen
to Count Louis of Trani, a broken-down <i>rou&eacute;</i>
who afterward died by his own hand. Neither of
these Princesses had seen their husbands before
their marriage.</p>
<p>Sophie, Duchess d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, the youngest of the
five sisters, was very beautiful and resembled the
Empress Elizabeth in appearance, though not at all
in disposition, for those who knew her as a young
girl describe her as being full of animation and
vivacity. She became engaged to her cousin Ludwig
Second of Bavaria a year after his accession to
the throne, and the betrothal met with general approval.
He was a strikingly handsome young man
of twenty at this time, and so desperately in love
with his cousin that he had a bust made of her by
a famous sculptor and placed in his winter garden
where he could always look at it. Just before the
wedding was to take place, however, he suddenly
broke the engagement without a word of preparation
or explanation, because he suspected that she
was untrue to him. There is no doubt that the
Princess was the victim of a deliberate plot to rob
her of the King&rsquo;s affection, but Ludwig made no
attempt at reparation of any kind and his behavior
made a breach between him and Duke Max&rsquo;s family
which was never healed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Ludwig himself, fed by continual flattery and
admiration and with a morbid idea of his own dignity,
was deeply injured by the supposed faithlessness
of his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. In the first transports of his
rage he seized the bust of the Princess and flung it
out of the window, dashing it to pieces on the
stones of the courtyard. Even at the beginning of
his reign he had shown signs of mental unsoundness,
but from this time he began to shun the society
of his fellow creatures and lived a solitary life.
He would have nothing more to do with women,
and except for a few chosen companions would see
no one. Even when obliged to receive his ministers,
he would hide behind a screen. The only exception
he made was in favor of his cousin Elizabeth,
with whom he was a great favorite in spite of his
erratic ways, and who also was devoted to him until
his death. They were much alike in temperament
as well as in appearance, and he always looked forward
to her arrival each summer at Feldafing, near
which was one of his favorite retreats, &ldquo;Roseninsel,&rdquo;
a small island shut in by dense shrubbery
and lofty trees. In olden times it had been the site
of a heathen temple which was replaced later by a
Roman Catholic chapel. The gardens, which were
laid out by King Maximilian Second, were greatly
enlarged and beautified by his son Ludwig and are
said to contain sixteen thousand of the choicest
varieties of roses, the perfume of which is wafted
far out across the lake. The Hermitage, a small
villa in the Italian style, and the gardener&rsquo;s cottage
are now the only buildings left in this wilderness of
flowers, so overgrown that it is almost impossible to
approach the little wharf where King Ludwig used
to land from his yacht <i>Tristan</i>. Here he collected
all his favorite authors and spent long happy days
dreaming over them or working in the garden, and
here too he and Elizabeth would meet and pour out
their hearts to each other, alone and undisturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>After all, who can say with certainty where human
reason ends and insanity begins? &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo;
the Empress once said, in speaking of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Hamlet, &ldquo;that those persons who are called mad
are not the really wise ones.&rdquo; King Ludwig&rsquo;s eccentricities
became so pronounced, however, that in
1886 he was forced to resign the government and
was sent to Schloss Berg on Lake Starnberg under
the care of a physician. One June evening they
went out to walk together as usual, and when, after
waiting in vain for their return, a search was made,
the bodies of both were found at length at the bottom
of the lake. Elizabeth happened to be staying
at Feldafing when the catastrophe occurred and was
deeply affected by the King&rsquo;s tragic death. She
hastened at once to the castle, and entering the room
where his lifeless body lay, requested to be left
alone with it. For an hour her attendants waited,
and at length, alarmed at the delay, ventured to
enter the apartment, where they found their mistress
stretched upon the floor, apparently lifeless.
It was only with the greatest difficulty that she was
restored to consciousness, and when at last she did
open her eyes, she stared wildly about her for some
moments, then cried in a shaking voice: &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
sake, release the King from the mortuary chapel!
He is not dead&mdash;he is only pretending to be so,
that he may be left in peace and not tormented any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Ludwig&rsquo;s body was carried back to Munich,
where he lay in state, the bier heaped about with
wreaths and floral offerings, but on the breast of the
dead King lay a simple spray of jasmine, Elizabeth&rsquo;s
last gift to her friend and kinsman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Empress&rsquo; Travels</span></h2>
<p>Urged by her love of nature and of new
scenes as well as by her inborn restlessness,
Elizabeth, as is well known, spent a
great part of her time travelling about
incognito from place to place like any ordinary
tourist. She never tired of studying strange lands
and peoples, and the constant change and communion
with nature calmed her tortured spirit as
nothing else could. &ldquo;One should never stay indoors
except when absolutely necessary,&rdquo; she declared,
&ldquo;and our homes should be so ordered as not
to destroy the illusions we bring in with us.&rdquo; The
sea had an irresistible attraction for her, and she
would pace up and down the deck of her yacht for
hours sometimes, ordering no one to speak to or
approach her. &ldquo;The sea is my father confessor,&rdquo;
she used to say; &ldquo;it removes all my cares and
troubles and has taught me all I know.&rdquo; Her
yacht <i>Miramar</i>, on which she spent so much of her
time, was elegantly and conveniently fitted up with
every comfort. On the deck was a large round
pavilion of glass commanding a view of the sea in
all directions, for her use in wet weather, but the
Empress&rsquo; favorite spot was the after deck, which
was shut off from the rest of the yacht with sail
cloth so that there should be nothing to interfere
with her outlook over the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>She usually travelled under the name of Countess
of Hohenembs, her Majesty&rsquo;s thirty-eighth title in
the Court Calendar. She loved to explore strange,
out-of-the-way places, and displayed wonderful enthusiasm
and endurance as a traveller. Of all lands,
however, she loved the East the best. Her favorite
cities were Tunis, Algiers, Cairo, and Alexandria,
and she was the first European sovereign to visit
Troy.</p>
<p>Her talent for languages was remarkable. Besides
German and Hungarian, she had mastered French,
English, and Greek, and had a fair knowledge of
Latin. She never cared to learn Italian, indeed she
had the greatest dislike to everything pertaining to
Italy, having been subjected to several outrages at
the hands of the people of that country. She had
narrowly escaped death at Trieste in the early
eighties, when a bomb was thrown into the citadel
where she was staying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Owing to the Empress&rsquo; reluctance to appear in
public, her features were not generally known in
Austria, a fact which led to many absurd situations.
One day when taking the train at M&ouml;dling she sent
her servant to order the station-master to have the
train stopped at a small station near her palace at
Lainz. Seeing that the train was about to start, she
called to the guard: &ldquo;Tell that man in the black
coat to make haste!&rdquo; Whereupon the officer
bawled out, &ldquo;Here, hurry up, you! or else your
good woman will go off and leave you!&rdquo; evidently
taking the Empress for the horrified servant&rsquo;s wife.
It was not always easy to preserve her incognito on
her travels, though she made every effort to do so
because of her keen enjoyment of the adventures
which it brought about.</p>
<p>In her younger days she used to spend much
time in Scotland and Ireland, where she delighted
in the hunting. During one of these visits in Ireland
the fox she was pursuing sprang over the wall
of Maynooth College, near which the chase had led
her, and dashed across the exercise ground where
the students were sauntering peacefully about.
Great was their amazement the next moment when
the wall was also cleared by several hounds and a
horsewoman on a magnificent hunter, who had evidently
followed the fox through a pond, for she was
dripping wet. The fox was quickly captured, and
the rider dismounted and asked to see the head of
the college, to whom she explained her identity, requesting
to be shown to a room where she could
change her clothes. No feminine garments were to
be found, however, in a seminary for young priests
and she was forced to borrow one of the doctors&rsquo;
cassocks. While her clothes were drying she invited
the professors to have tea with her, charmed
them all with her graciousness, and caused much
merriment by her comical appearance and lively
descriptions of her adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Once while in Amsterdam, where she occasionally
went to be treated by an eminent specialist in
nervous disorders, she entered a toy shop to buy
a doll, saying to her companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure my granddaughter will be delighted
when she gets this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shop-keeper, thinking it impossible that
this slender, youthful-looking person could be a
grandmother, made some remark to that effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have four grandchildren,&rdquo; said the
Empress, &ldquo;and to prove it I will come again soon
and buy some toys for the other three. You may
send them to my daughter, the Princess Gisela in
Munich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor shop-keeper was dumfounded and
humbly apologized for his rudeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not rude,&rdquo; said Elizabeth kindly;
&ldquo;on the contrary, you were very flattering.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>She was usually regarded as somewhat eccentric
in Amsterdam, from her habit of always holding a
fan before her face in the street, and once a street
urchin ran up to her and snatched it away, crying,
&ldquo;Let me see your face!&rdquo; But in spite of the
unpleasant experiences which her incognito occasionally
created, she could never be induced to
abandon it and was much displeased when people
did not respect her wishes in this matter. When
one of the servants at a Spanish hotel, where she
had registered as &ldquo;Frau Folna of Corfu,&rdquo; addressed
her as &ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; she retorted sharply,
&ldquo;There are no Highnesses in my apartments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would often start off on the spur of the moment
to see some work of art of which she had heard
without telling any of her suite where they were
going. Her Greek teacher, Professor Rhousso
Rhoussopoulos, relates that on one occasion when
the Empress was staying at Wiesbaden for the
baths, he suddenly received orders to get ready to
accompany herself and the Archduchess Marie
Valerie on a journey, and not until they reached
the railway station did he learn that their destination
was Frankfort-on-the-Main, where Elizabeth
wanted to see Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s reliefs and Danecker&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ariadne,&rdquo; which were in the Rothschild collection
there. Luncheon had been ordered for them at
the station restaurant at Frankfort. The Empress
was in high spirits, and taking her daughter&rsquo;s arm,
walked up and down, watching the people and
enjoying the bustle of the station. She was delighted
that no one recognized her and ate the first part of
her luncheon with great relish. But when the second
course arrived it was specially served on gold
plate with extra attendants; evidently her identity
had been discovered. Instantly her cheerfulness
vanished and she hastily finished the meal in order
to escape as soon as possible. There was nothing
she disliked so much as being stared at.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>As Professor Rhoussopoulos was walking with
her one day in a North German city, she suddenly
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look how that woman across the street is staring
at us! What do you suppose it means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it is only a bad habit she has, your
Majesty,&rdquo; replied the professor; but before the
words were out of his mouth the Empress had
rushed across the street and the next moment the
two women were in each other&rsquo;s arms. It was her
sister, the Countess of Trani, who was almost as
fond of travelling as Elizabeth herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Wherever she went the Empress was perpetually
at warfare with the police authorities whose duty it
was to watch over her safety. She resorted to all
sorts of devices to elude and mislead them, and
their task was no easy one. Once when she and
the Emperor were staying at Mentone, she sent
for the chief of police there and told him that it
annoyed her exceedingly to be continually followed
about by detectives and she wished it stopped. The
officer replied that he was compelled to perform his
duties, and if it displeased Her Majesty there was
nothing left for him but to resign his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the Empress. &ldquo;Remain in Mentone,
by all means, and devote yourself to protecting
my husband, for his life is most necessary to his subjects.
As for me, what am I? A mere stranger and
far too unimportant to attract any attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An English journalist was glancing over some
books one day in front of a second-hand bookshop
in Monza, when the dealer came out and asked
him to go away, as the lady inside did not wish to
be followed about, evidently supposing him to be a
detective. Curious to know who the lady was, he
cast a searching glance through the window and
recognized the Empress. Taking out one of his
cards, he handed it to the dealer with the request
that he inform his illustrious customer of her mistake.
An hour later, as he was strolling through
the palace grounds, he saw Her Majesty a short distance
in front of him. Not wishing to arouse her
suspicions a second time, he was about to turn down
a side path, when she beckoned him to approach
and with much dignity and graciousness explained
to him the annoyance she was subjected to by the
officiousness of the police, and apologized for the
scene at the bookshop. Late the next evening, as
the journalist entered a well-known restaurant in
Milan, great was his amazement to find the Empress
seated at one of the tables quite alone and unattended.
As he took his seat near by, one of the
waiters came to her and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather late, signora, to get anything good;
almost everything is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am hungry,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth; &ldquo;you
will have to find me something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man disappeared and was back again in a
moment. &ldquo;There is just one course left, signora,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but it is the best of all. I can recommend
it, for I have just eaten some of it myself. But it
is a trifle dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much does this superior dish cost?&rdquo;
asked the Empress, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty centesimi,&rdquo; said the waiter doubtfully.</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The signora need not laugh,&rdquo; he went on in an
offended tone; &ldquo;most people find it so dear they
order only a half portion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The journalist had sat all this time hidden behind
his newspaper, but the Empress recognized him
at once and addressing him pleasantly with &ldquo;Good-evening,
Herr Journalist,&rdquo; continued to converse
with him during the meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>She was extremely fond of Paris and rarely failed
to go there when on her European tours, though
always as Countess of Hohenembs and never as
Empress of Austria. She would often meet her
sisters, the Duchess d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on and the Countess of
Trani, and go about with them, as she could do
so there without fear of annoyance. One day she
took a fancy to ride on an omnibus, but when
the driver came to collect her fare she gave him
two pieces of gold, an act of munificence that
stunned the frugal Parisians and led to her being
recognized. Annoyed at the curious interest of the
other passengers, she hastily alighted and took
refuge in the nearest house, where she waited till
the crowd had dispersed and then drove back to
her hotel in a closed carriage with the shades closely
drawn, vowing it was the last time she would ever
attempt to ride on an omnibus in a city like Paris.</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Empress&rsquo; Literary Tastes</span></h2>
<p>Elizabeth was passionately fond of
both music and poetry. From her father
she had acquired a perfect mastery of the
zither, but she had also a beautiful voice
and was a piano pupil of Liszt, and often sung and
played at court charity concerts. Her favorite composers
were Rubinstein, Chopin, and Wagner, to
the latter of whom she proved a true friend by
sending him a large sum of money at one of his
times of greatest need, and after his death she made
one of her incognito trips to Bayreuth to hear the
Wagner productions there.</p>
<p>For art, too, she had the greatest enthusiasm.
Both Makart and Munkacsy were warm personal
friends of hers and she would often spend hours in
their studios. She never went to the theatre in her
later years, but always manifested great interest in
the foremost actors and actresses in Austria and
showed them many kindnesses on various occasions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>It was in literature, however, and poetry in particular,
that she found her greatest inspiration and
distraction. She was never without a book in her
hand and would sit or wander about for hours so
absorbed in her reading as to completely forget the
passage of time, while as for her general knowledge
competent judges have declared it to be amazing.
&ldquo;To converse intelligently with the Empress,&rdquo; said
Hasenauer, &ldquo;one should be well versed in history,
science, and art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She translated the whole of Schopenhauer into
modern Greek and was an earnest student of Rousseau
and Voltaire. But her prime favorite in the
literary world was Heinrich Heine, for whom she
had the greatest reverence and admiration; she possessed
all his works, many of them in manuscript,
and many touching instances are told of her kindness
to the great poet&rsquo;s family. She had learned to
love his poems soon after her marriage, in her first
days of sorrow and disillusionment, and they always
found a responsive echo in her heart. Anxious that
his memory should be honored publicly, she interested
herself in the erection of a monument to him
in some German city, heading the subscription list
herself with a large sum. The plan was in a fair
way to succeed, when a letter arrived from Bismarck
to the cabinet in Vienna, expressing his surprise that
the ruler of a friendly neighboring country should
wish to do public honor to a poet who had insulted
the Hohenzollerns. As a rule, Franz Joseph and
Elizabeth respected each other&rsquo;s peculiarities and
differences of taste, but in this case, on account of
the Triple Alliance, the Emperor was obliged to
ask his wife to remove her name from the list, and,
thanks to this episode, it remains for the future to
erect a monument to Heine in Germany. But
Elizabeth was determined not to be thwarted and had
her revenge, for, learning that the Danish sculptor
Hasselriis in Rome had already prepared designs
for a statue of her favorite poet, she commissioned
him to execute it in marble and had it placed in
front of her palace at Corfu. Apparently the Hohenzollerns
did not resent this, however, for the
then Emperor of Germany was most attentive to
her whenever she was travelling in that country.
He always made a point of calling upon her with
his wife and is said to have considered her one of
the cleverest women he ever met.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>There were not many books that she cared for,
but she loved to read her favorites again and again.
Heine was the only one of the German poets
whose works she understood and treasured. Neither
Goethe nor Schiller appealed to her, nor did the
modern French poets interest her, although she
thought highly of Lamartine. In English she
specially admired Shakespeare and Byron, Shakespeare
indeed ranking only second to Heine in
her affections. She made excellent translations of
several of his plays and could repeat whole scenes
from them by heart. &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; were her favorites, and she
had a painting of Titania and her lover with the
ass&rsquo;s head hanging in each of her palaces. &ldquo;Our
illusions are the asses&rsquo; heads that we all kiss,&rdquo; she
used to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>She wrote charmingly herself, and while on the
long journeys that consumed so much of her time
she would send long letters every week to her husband
and children, containing brilliant descriptions
of her travels, bits of poetry or translations, often
illustrated with exquisite pen-and-ink or water-color
sketches. These valuable souvenirs are all
preserved in the Hofburg, together with what she
called her &ldquo;day-book,&rdquo; a sort of diary covering
many years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Daily Life of the Empress</span></h2>
<p>As time went on, the hereditary disease of
the Wittelsbachs, now known as neurasthenia,
which for generations had manifested
itself in one form or another, became
more and more pronounced in the Empress Elizabeth.
Her passion for solitude, her aversion to
mingling with people, and constant craving for
change must certainly be regarded as inherited peculiarities,
though she was more ill than was
generally suspected. A complication of disorders
together with neuritis made her later years a perpetual
martyrdom, yet she bore her sufferings with
a patience and fortitude that her physicians pronounced
almost superhuman.</p>
<p>It was a bitter sacrifice for her to give up her
riding, but fortunately she was still able to take the
walks and climbs that meant so much to her.
Often, indeed, it was not so much the love of
exercise as the effort to find relief in physical exhaustion
from the sleeplessness that tortured her
and secure the rest so necessary to her overwrought
nerves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Always a remarkably small eater, her tastes were
extremely simple. For weeks at a time she would
live on nothing but milk, and even at state banquets
often took nothing but a slice or two of wheat bread,
a cup of bouillon, and some fruit. She detested liquor
of any sort, and never tasted it except when the
physicians insisted upon her drinking a little wine
for her health. As a rule, she had little respect for
medical knowledge and much preferred to treat
herself with her own remedies. She had a morbid
horror of getting stout. Every day she had herself
weighed, and if her usual weight increased at all
she would live on oranges till it was reduced to
the proper amount, in spite of her physicians&rsquo; warnings
of the danger of so slender a diet. But although
Elizabeth cared so little for eating, when at
home she gave much attention to the menus presented
to her each morning by the chef, which she
often altered to suit herself. No table could be
served more daintily and artistically than that of
the Austrian court when the Empress was present.
She selected the costliest porcelain and glass and had
gold and silver services for all her palaces, though
they were rarely used owing to her long absences.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Maria Theresa had sixteen children, and her son
the Emperor Leopold Second seventeen; so the
Austrian imperial family is a large one, aside from
the numbers of foreign princes in Vienna who are
related to the house of Hapsburg-Lorraine. But
except on one or two state occasions in the course
of the winter these distant connections rarely saw
either Franz Joseph or Elizabeth. Absorbed in
cares of state and caring for little but his shooting
trips in later years, the Emperor led almost as solitary
a life as his wife. When they were together
with their children, the Empress always strove to
make these reunions as happy and cheerful as possible,
as if to make up in some degree for the family
life her long absences deprived him of. They would
spend long cosey evenings on the terraces or by the
fireside, and Rudolf would often join the party, or,
if the Emperor were busy, Elizabeth would entertain
herself with Marie Valerie and some of her ladies-in-waiting.
The court in general, however, kept
aloof from her. Her manner was cold and forbidding
to those she did not like, though her intimate
companions had the deepest love and admiration
for her and she was worshipped by her servants,
none of whom was too humble to share her sympathy
and interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>One morning in Vienna it was learned that one of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s maids had died during the night, and
very harsh comments were made on the fact of the
Empress having been seen riding in the Prater on
that very same afternoon. It was not told, however,
that she had spent the whole of the previous
night at the dying woman&rsquo;s bedside, and it was only
when death had ended the maid&rsquo;s sufferings that
the Empress had gone out into the fresh air.</p>
<p>Nature endowed Elizabeth with great beauty, a
noble nature, and a good mind; fate gave her
wealth and the most exalted position a woman can
occupy, and she seemed to have been destined for
a life of ease and happiness. Perfect as she seemed
in outward appearance, however, her character was
full of contradictions. She loved nothing so much
as freedom and solitude, yet when forced to appear
in public, no princess in Europe could equal her
for grace and majesty. Simple and economical in
her own tastes and habits, in many respects she
had no idea of money, as, for instance, when she
furnished her cousin Ludwig of Bavaria with enormous
sums to gratify his passion for building palaces.
Her generosity was boundless, and wherever
she went she scattered gifts and money broadcast.
She never followed the freaks of fashion, yet her
slender figure was the delight and envy of modistes.
She dressed as simply as any of her attendants,
but whatever she wore it was impossible to
conceal her inborn dignity and air of distinction.
Her favorite costume for every-day wear was a short,
close-fitting skirt with loose waist, and she never
put on her elaborate court dresses except when absolutely
necessary, though even these always bore
the stamp of her individuality. In her later years
she was rarely seen in anything but black or white;
on a few special occasions she would wear light gray
or lilac, but never bright colors. Her hair never
lost its beauty, though before her death it began to
show a trace of silver here and there,&mdash;much to her
annoyance, for she had a horror of growing gray.
When loosened, it fell far below her knees and enveloped
her like a mantle. She used to have it
brushed for hours every day and often grew impatient
of the trouble it caused her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;My hair tires me,&rdquo; she said one day to her
Greek teacher, running her hands through its waves
as if to relieve herself of a burden, &ldquo;it is such a
weight upon my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Your Majesty&rsquo;s crown!&rdquo; was the courtly
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not so easy to remove as the other kind of
a crown!&rdquo; she retorted with a melancholy smile.</p>
<p>Another time she declared impatiently: &ldquo;I am a
perfect slave to my hair! I think I shall have it
all cut off sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But remarks such as these were made only in
moments of annoyance and weariness. As a matter
of fact, she was very proud of her magnificent
tresses. It was almost the only sign of vanity she
ever displayed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Death of Crown Prince Rudolf</span></h2>
<p>On the thirty-first of January, 1889, a
terrible affliction befell the Emperor and
Empress in the sudden and violent death
of their only son. The tragedy of Mayerling
is well known in its main points, and hundreds
of different stories have been told concerning
it, but the real circumstances of the affair are
wrapped in impenetrable secrecy, and perhaps it is
just as well if what the King of Belgium wrote to
his brother, the Count of Flanders, is true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any report,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is better than that the
real truth should be revealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that is known with certainty is that the
Crown Prince was found dead in his bed with a
frightful wound in his head at his hunting lodge at
Mayerling, near Vienna, where he had been spending
a few days. In the same room lay the body
of a young girl, the Baroness Vetsera, with whom
he had been in love. It was difficult to believe
that both had committed suicide, and there are facts
which seem to indicate that Rudolf may have been
murdered. The rest is all conjecture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The unfortunate Prince was extremely popular
with all classes and had many brilliant qualities, but
after his marriage he developed habits which caused
some anxiety as to his future. There was one
person, however, who never lost faith in him, and
that was his mother. She had wisely and carefully
prepared him for the position he was to occupy in
the world, and it was to her training and influence
that he owed much of his early popularity. All
Vienna was paralyzed with horror on the cold gray
morning when word was brought from Mayerling
of the Crown Prince&rsquo;s death. No one knew just
what had happened. No details of the affair were
published and the confusion was indescribable. It
was thought best to convey the news at once to the
Empress, though many feared the shock might
destroy her life or reason. As events proved, however,
her mind and nerves were stronger than those
of most people. She seemed stunned at first and
turned away without speaking, her face drawn and
colorless, but collecting herself she inquired in a
dry, unnatural tone where her son was. Then her
thoughts flew at once to her husband, who as yet
knew nothing of what had happened. No one had
the courage to tell him, but while the matter was
being discussed Elizabeth stepped forward, pale but
quite self-possessed, and declaring that it was her
place to break it to the Emperor, left the room
immediately. During the terrible days that followed
the Empress gave ample proof, if it were needed,
of her true nobility and strength of character.
With heroic courage she stifled her own feelings to
soothe and comfort her grief-stricken husband, and
supported him bravely all through the endless ceremonies
that accompanied the burial of their unfortunate
child with whom so many hopes had perished.
Well might Franz Joseph say, as he did when
expressing his thanks to the people of Vienna for
their sympathy: &ldquo;What I owe to the courage
and devotion of my beloved wife in this time of
trouble, I can never adequately express, and I
thank God with all my heart for bestowing on me
so noble a consort.&rdquo; Ten days later, the imperial
pair, accompanied by Marie Valerie, left Vienna for
Hungary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Rudolf had been the first prince of the reigning
house to give promise of being a really constitutional
monarch. He wrote and spoke the Hungarian
language like a native, was thoroughly familiar
with all parts of the country, and well liked by
both the people and the aristocracy. In his death
Hungary suffered an irreparable loss, and throughout
the kingdom there was genuine grief over his
tragic fate, while the depth of public sympathy for the
afflicted parents was shown in the warmth of the reception
they received in Budapest. In a conversation
with Dr. Christomanos some years before her death
Elizabeth declared: &ldquo;In every human life there
is a moment when one dies inwardly and that need
not necessarily be the time when death actually
takes place.&rdquo; This moment to her was when they
brought her the news of her son&rsquo;s death. She was
never the same afterward. At the time of the catastrophe
she had shown the courage of a heroine,
but after her wonderful self-control had given way,
the reaction was terrible and her despair heart-breaking.
&ldquo;I have no longer the strength to live
nor the desire to die,&rdquo; she said. It was reported
in Berlin that her reason was destroyed, nor would
it have been surprising if this had been the case
after such a shock. Of course it was not true, but
she did begin to develop symptoms of a serious
heart trouble from which she suffered until her
death. She never wished to see the Crown Princess
Stephanie again, nor could she endure the presence
of the little Archduchess Elizabeth, the grandchild
who had inherited her father&rsquo;s nature with the
features of a mother to whose behavior the Empress
attributed the changes in Rudolf&rsquo;s way of
life and his tragic fate. She shrank from contact
with people more and more and often wounded
her husband and children by her craving for solitude.
Even her favorite palace of Lainz failed to
attract her for more than a few weeks, while at
G&ouml;d&ouml;ll&ouml; the roses drooped and faded and the
grass grew thick upon her once-loved bridle
paths.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="caption"><i>EMPRESS ELIZABETH in later years</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>On the Christmas Eve following the death of the
Crown Prince, her mother&rsquo;s fifty-second birthday,
the Archduchess Marie Valerie was betrothed to
her cousin Franz Salvator, Duke of Tuscany, an
event that was a cause of happiness and satisfaction
to all concerned. Next to her parents&rsquo; blessing
she was anxious to have that of her grandmother,
and the day after Christmas accordingly she left for
Munich, accompanied by her mother and her lover.
Duke Max had died in 1888, shortly after the diamond
wedding celebration at Possenhoffen, but the
Duchess Ludovica, though bowed with age and
many sorrows, had lost none of her mental acuteness
and the meeting between the old lady and her
daughter and granddaughter was most touching.
From there they went to Wiesbaden and Heidelberg,
where they spent the spring months. As
they were returning to Vienna, they narrowly escaped
death by the derailing of the train near
Frankfort. Several of the coaches were overturned
and crushed, but none of the imperial party, strange
to say, was injured. Scarcely had the Empress
reached home when she was called to Regensburg
by the sudden death there of her eldest sister,
Helene of Thurn and Taxis, and after the funeral
she went again to Munich to comfort her grief-stricken
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The marriage of Marie Valerie and Franz Salvator
that summer was one of the few happy events
of Elizabeth&rsquo;s later life. On that occasion she laid
aside her mourning for a pale gray silk gown, and
for the first time since Rudolf&rsquo;s death made an effort
to smile and appear cheerful. But the brief
gleam soon vanished. The Archduchess had been
the one bright spot in her life, and even though she
was to remain in the country as the wife of an Austrian
prince, Elizabeth realized that the relations
between them could never be the same again. She
had lost her dearest companion.</p>
<p>On the twenty-fifth of January, 1892, her burden
of sorrow was increased by the death of her mother,
and she retired to Achilleon, where she had had a
monument erected to her unfortunate son that she
might be alone with memories of her beloved dead.
Even her attendants saw her for only a short time
each day, and she lived mostly in a world of dreams.
Her favorite poets still afforded her solace and diversion,
but she grew to care less for books than for
the solitude, which she peopled with creations of her
own fancy. Her reader sometimes tried to interest
her in new authors, but her thoughts would soon
wander and her absent expression prove the uselessness
of such attempts. Only Shakespeare or
Heine had power to fix her attention, and she would
often interrupt her reading to recite favorite verses
or passages to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The only court ceremony at which the Empress
appeared after the death of her son was on the
occasion of the visit of the present Czar and Czarina
of Russia to Vienna. Her presence at the state
reception given in their honor excited even more
interest and curiosity than did that of the young
Czarina herself, and all eyes were fixed upon her
as she entered on the arm of the Russian Emperor,
smiling and bowing graciously to those about her.
She was dressed in black, as usual, but looked
twenty years younger than any of her contemporaries.
In spite of all her sorrows and sufferings
she could still be truthfully called the most beautiful
woman at her court. But her thoughts were
continually straying from her guests and from the
brilliant scene about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There often seems to be a thick veil between
me and the world, as if I were masquerading in
the costume of an Empress,&rdquo; she once remarked.
&ldquo;When I am with people I only show the part of
me that we have in common, and they are surprised
that I am so much like them when I talk
about the weather and the price of candy. It is
like taking a dress out of the wardrobe and putting
it on for certain occasions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>In 1896 Hungary celebrated her thousandth anniversary.
Elizabeth was even more miserable than
usual at the time, and did not feel that she could
be present, but it was urged that her absence would
cast a shadow over the festivities, and, ill as she was
both in body and mind, she finally was persuaded
and appeared beside her husband on the throne.
Dressed all in black, with a long veil worn Hungarian
fashion over her hair, she sat pale and
motionless as a statue, her long eyelashes drooping
and an expression of unspeakable sadness on her
lovely face. Not a muscle moved as the speaker
began his address of welcome. She seemed neither
to see nor hear until he spoke the word
&ldquo;Elizabeth&rdquo; and a mighty shout went up from
the whole assembly that seemed to shake the
marble walls of the throne room. Then the majestic
head was lowered slightly, almost imperceptibly,
but with wonderful grace and charm in
acknowledgment of this tribute. Again the cheers
rose louder than before and lasted several minutes,
even the highest nobles of the kingdom waving
their tufted kalpaks high in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s head sank, her deadly pallor giving
place to a faint flush. Her eyes opened wide with
a flash of their old brilliancy, and a tear rolled slowly
down her cheek. It was plain that the affection
between Elizabeth and her Hungarian subjects had
undergone no change. The speaker went on with
his address, the flush slowly faded from her cheeks,
and soon she sat beside the Emperor, a Mater
Dolorosa once more. It was her last visit to Hungary
and her last appearance on the throne.</p>

<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Death of the Empress</span></h2>
<p>The Empress Elizabeth had no fear of
death, though the thought of it was often
in her mind. &ldquo;I am ready to die,&rdquo; she
used to say; &ldquo;all I ask is that I may not
live to suffer.&rdquo; She had a presentiment that she
was to die an unnatural death and believed it would
be by drowning. Sometimes when walking along
the shore or on the deck of her yacht she would
say: &ldquo;The sea will have me some day; I know I
belong to it.&rdquo; Her forebodings were destined to
be fulfilled, though in a manner that neither she
nor any one else could have foreseen, for the life
that began so like a summer idyl ended in a
tragedy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>In the Spring of 1897 a terrible fate befell her
sister Sophie while assisting at a charity bazar held
in Paris by the ladies of the French aristocracy.
About four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the fourth
of May the lamp of a cinematograph exploded, setting
fire to some draperies. The hall was a flimsily
built structure, and the flames spread with such
rapidity that in a few moments the whole place was
a sea of fire and the greater part of those present
were unable to escape. One hundred and thirty
people perished in this frightful disaster, among
them the Duchess d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, Ludwig of Bavaria&rsquo;s
former <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. It was known that she must have
perished, for her wedding ring was found among
the ruins soon after the conflagration, though it was
not till some days later that her body was found
and identified.</p>
<p>The Queen of Naples and Mathilde of Trani
were now Elizabeth&rsquo;s only surviving sisters, and of
these the latter was her favorite. They had many
traits in common, particularly their aversion to
society and their love of travel. The Countess of
Trani, who spent most of her time at hotels and
watering-places, usually went by the modest title of
&ldquo;Fr&auml;ulein Nelly Schmidt.&rdquo; The last Christmas of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s life the two sisters spent together in
Paris, but an acute attack of neuritis forced the
Empress to hasten southward, and taking her yacht
<i>Miramar</i> at Marseilles, they went to San Remo.
Here they stayed for two months, leaving on the
first of March for Territet in Switzerland, where
they parted never to meet again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Elizabeth was fond of returning to familiar places,
and Lake Geneva was one of her favorite spots.
From Territet she used to go every day by rail to
Glion and from there on foot to Mont de Caux,
accompanied only by one of her ladies or her
reader, a young man named Frederick Barker.</p>
<p>After a six weeks&rsquo; stay in Switzerland she returned
to Vienna and went with the Emperor to Lainz.
Never had her mind appeared so clouded as now.
The veil of melancholia had settled over her thicker
and heavier than ever. Her glance was restless,
there was an unspeakable weariness in her expression,
and hard and bitter lines had appeared about
her mouth. Constant suffering made life a torment
to her and she could find no rest day or night.</p>
<p>Early in August she went as usual with her husband
and Valerie&rsquo;s family to Ischl to celebrate the
Emperor&rsquo;s birthday. It was the only day in the
year on which she laid aside her mourning, and
the imperial pair usually went together to church.
This time, however, she left earlier and went to
Mannheim to take some special massage treatment
recommended by her physicians. Her health improved
so much that she was able to eat and sleep
again and to resume her excursions about the
neighborhood, though still too weak to take the
long walks and climbs she was so fond of.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>On the twenty-ninth of August she went back to
Switzerland, this time by special train to Mont de
Caux, where she could be more quiet than at Territet.
She seemed unusually well, and those who
met the slender black-robed foreign lady, chatting
familiarly with her one companion, little surmised
that she was the sovereign of one of the greatest
powers of Europe and ruler over more than forty
million people. In a letter to the Emperor written
at this time she expressed regret that he was not
sharing the peace and pleasure of her stay here and
urged him to join her, declaring that she was feeling
so much better she hoped to be present at his
approaching jubilee, the fiftieth anniversary of his
accession to the throne.</p>
<p>On the ninth of September she suddenly decided
to make a visit to Pregny, a beautiful villa on the
shores of Lake Geneva, that had once belonged to
Joseph Bonaparte, but is now in the possession
of the Rothschild family. The Baroness Adolph
Rothschild had been very kind to the Queen of
Naples in her days of misfortune, and Elizabeth
was anxious to show her some attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>She had gone for a stroll the preceding afternoon
in the neighborhood of Territet with her reader,
Mr. Barker, who had taken with him a basket of
fruit for her refreshment. Seating herself on some
moss-grown rocks, the Empress peeled a peach, half
of which she offered to her companion. Just as
she was in the act of handing it to him, a huge
raven flew down from a tree near by, flapping its
wings almost in her face and knocking the peach
from her hand. Remembering the famous legend
of the raven, which is always said to appear to
the Hapsburgs as a forerunner of misfortune, the
startled reader sprang to his feet in alarm and
begged her to abandon the trip to Geneva.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid, my friend,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth.
&ldquo;We must all meet our fate sooner or later, and
whatever is destined to happen will happen. Nothing
we can do will alter it. You know I am a
fatalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day she went to Pregny, as she had
planned, accompanied only by her Hungarian lady-in-waiting,
the Countess Sztaray. She was in a remarkably
cheerful mood, most gracious and friendly
with the Baroness and much pleased with her visit.
Late in the afternoon she arrived at the H&ocirc;tel Beaurivage,
where she was in the habit of staying. Every
precaution had been taken as usual to preserve her
incognito, though the servants, remembering her
from former visits, were no doubt well aware of
her identity. On her first arrival in Switzerland
the police of the canton had been charged to watch
over her safety, but she had wished as usual to be
spared their espionage and left to go her own way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>At noon on the tenth of September, 1898, she
left the hotel with her lady-in-waiting to take the
steamer to Mont de Caux. They were a little late,
and the Countess Sztaray hurried on in advance of
her mistress to signal the captain to wait for them.
Just at that moment a man arose from a bench on
the quay where he had been sitting as they passed.
It was the Italian Luigi Luccheni, a dangerous
anarchist on whom the Swiss authorities had been
warned to keep a watchful eye. With one bound
he flung himself upon the Empress and plunged a
dagger into her breast. The Countess was unaware
that anything had happened, but turning just in
time to see her mistress stagger, ran and caught her
in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Your Majesty ill?&rdquo; she asked in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Your Majesty take my arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I do not think I need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Though ghastly pale, she walked to the steamer
without assistance, crossed the gang-plank, and then
fell fainting to the deck. The steamer started, and
the Countess Sztaray with some of the women on
board endeavored to restore her to consciousness.
No one suspected that she had been wounded until
the Countess, loosening her dress to give her more
air, discovered stains of blood on her clothing.
Just then Elizabeth opened her eyes and in a clear,
distinct voice asked, &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; then
sank again into unconsciousness. Now thoroughly
alarmed, the Countess informed the captain of her
mistress&rsquo; identity, and the boat was turned back at
once to Geneva, where Elizabeth was carried on a
stretcher to the hotel and laid upon her bed. Three
physicians who happened to be staying there at the
time were hastily summoned and did all in their
power to revive her, but in vain: about three o&rsquo;clock
she gave one or two deep sighs and passed away
quietly and painlessly, as she had so often expressed
a wish to do.</p>
<p>So cold-blooded and unprovoked an assault in
broad daylight and in the public street of a large
city was one of the most shocking crimes of modern
times and aroused the horror and indignation of
the whole civilized world. Elizabeth of Austro-Hungary
had no enemies. She had exerted no influence
in politics, directly or indirectly, nor was
she interested in state affairs. As her grief-stricken
husband said of her, &ldquo;she had done much good and
never harmed a human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Empress&rsquo; salon in the hotel was quickly
transformed into a mortuary chapel. The walls
were hung with black, tall candles placed about
the coffin, at the foot of which knelt monks reciting
prayers for the dead, and over the bier fell a
purple velvet pall, in the corner of which some young
Swiss girls had embroidered the words &ldquo;<i>R&eacute;pose en
paix.</i>&rdquo; Elizabeth was dressed as she had been in
life, in black, her hands folded over a rosary and an
ivory crucifix. The beautiful features were not
altered, but had changed their look of suffering to
an expression of wonderful majesty and peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>On the evening of the eleventh of September a
special train bearing her remains left Geneva and
passed slowly through Switzerland and Austria amid
the tolling of bells, and was met at every stop by
sorrowing throngs eager to pay a last tribute to the
dead Empress.</p>
<p>The Emperor was overwhelmed with messages of
sympathy from all parts of the globe. Flowers and
funeral wreaths came from high and low alike in
every land that she had visited. Even China and
the Transvaal sent offerings to lay upon the Empress&rsquo;
coffin. From Cairo came a wreath made of
desert blooms, hundreds of Jericho roses, the old
Christian emblem of the resurrection, and lotus
blossoms, symbolic of eternity.</p>
<p>Her death made almost as deep an impression in
most of the foreign capitals as in Vienna, where for
years she had been so little seen that her Austrian
subjects had almost forgotten how she looked, and
her assassination aroused less sorrow than rage
against the wretch who could have slain a defenceless
woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>In Hungary, however, the public mourning was
deep and profound. Every flag was at half-mast
and the streets were full of sobbing men and women.
The great autumn man&oelig;uvres were abandoned, and
it was decreed that her biography should be recorded
in the national archives, so that her memory might
be forever preserved in the history of the country.</p>
<p>The Empress Elizabeth&rsquo;s personal fortune was a
large one. Her jewels alone&mdash;presents from Franz
Joseph and other royal personages&mdash;were valued at
four million gulden. Her will was made at Budapest
in 1896. It was very short and written in her
own hand. Her palace at Lainz was bequeathed to
her daughter Valerie; Achilleon, in Corfu, to the
elder, Gisela. All her servants and ladies-in-waiting
received legacies, and a number of old friends were
also remembered. To her old reader and companion,
Ida von Ferenczy, who had been with her
for thirty years, she left an annuity, besides a considerable
sum of money and a life residence in the
imperial palace.</p>
<p class="tb">In earlier days Elizabeth had expressed a wish to
be buried at G&ouml;d&ouml;ll&ouml;, then her favorite residence,
but in her will she mentioned Achilleon as her
chosen place of burial. Her desire was not fulfilled,
however. Indulgent as Franz Joseph had been
toward his wife&rsquo;s eccentricities during her lifetime,
he was not willing that her hatred of conventionality
should be exhibited in her death, and determined
that her body should be laid to rest with those
of former Empresses and members of his family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>In the heart of Vienna there stands an insignificant-looking
chapel belonging to the Capuchins.
Above a side door are the words &ldquo;Imperial Vaults,&rdquo;
and a flight of well-worn steps leads down into the
dim burial-place of the royal race of Hapsburg. It
was into this chamber that the great Maria Theresa
used to force her gay young daughters to descend
to meditate on the perishability of all earthly greatness,
and here she herself would spend hours beside
the tomb of her husband. At the end of a cross
passage stands the tomb of the murdered Empress,
between that of her brother-in-law, the murdered
Emperor of Mexico, and her son Rudolf, who also
met with a violent end.</p>
<p>In life she had shunned all religious observances;
now masses are said day and night for the repose of
her soul. Every morning the gates of the crypt
are opened, and she who in life so loved solitude
and seclusion is a mark for the gaze of hundreds of
curious sightseers.</p>
<p>How much more fitting a place of rest for the
nature-loving Empress the sunny shores of her Greek
island would have been than the gloomy burial
chamber of the Capuchins! How much finer a
requiem the sighing of winds and waters than the
chantings of vestured priests!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>To the world in general Elizabeth of Austria
and Hungary will be little remembered as the
queenly sovereign in all the insignia of her lofty rank,
but rather as the beautiful and unfortunate daughter
of the Wittelsbachs, following her solitary way
through life, her lonely spirit ever seeking rest and
peace in vain. Terrible as it seemed to die by the
hand of an assassin in a foreign country, far from
all she loved, the dagger of Luccheni was but the
instrument of fate, and death came to her almost as
a friend. She died, as she had often wished to die,
swiftly and painlessly and under the open sky. Who
shall say that her last earthly breath was not a sigh
of thankfulness and peace?</p>
